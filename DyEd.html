 style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Laying
face down on the floor of St. John's Cathedral in Cleveland, Ohio, I
waited to be ordained a Roman Catholic priest. Somewhere behind me in
the big cathedral, my mother knelt in prayer. She was happy and proud
&ndash; her son was becoming a priest.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">I
thought about my dad in heaven, dead six years. He was proud of me,
too. He himself was in the seminary for a few years. I didn't think it
then, but maybe I was fulfilling his life.</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent2"
 style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">I was
going to be a good priest to help people. My mom and dad had donated
many hours to young people in the parish and I learned from them. I'd
been a model seminarian, trusted by church authorities, conservative in
my views. My mother made no secret of her desire that one day I would
be a bishop.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">We
rose from the floor and one-by-one we approached the bishop. I knelt in
front of him and he ordained me. "You are a priest forever," he said. I
turned and faced the mass of people in the cathedral. This was my
future, to serve these people and others like them.</p>

Holy Family Parish, Parma, Ohio, a Cleveland suburb. Priests' breakfast
table in the rectory. An older priest, Bob Knuff, walked in.</p>

 style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>I passed him that section. "No, Bob, it's great stuff. All
about world peace and poverty and racism. The Pope thinks democracy is
a pretty good governmental structure and he thinks the UN's doing a
good job."</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"

with God. Where's the report of last night's game?"</p>

Give it up, kid. Preach about the Blessed Mother. That's what the
people want to hear."</p>

      </span>The<span style="">&nbsp; </span>pastor, Father Benisek,
shuffled in to breakfast, nursing his arthritic hip. He flicked on the
TV to the morning show before he sat down.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Vic
pointed to my book. "Hey, Bill, look what the kid's reading &ndash; an
encyclical. Can you believe it?"</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Which
one?"</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"

      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Father
Benisek snorted his disapproval and turned his attention to the TV
where black people were picketing a Cleveland business. "Communists,"
he muttered. "Outside agitators," and he snorted more disapproval.
Then, "Pass the toast, Vic."</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">I
turned to my seat mate, Father Tom Gallagher. "Come on, Tom, let's go
talk to him."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was referring to Martin
Luther King who sat in the front of the plane. We were on our way to
Selma to join his historic march to the state capitol in Montgomery,
Alabama for voting rights. Doctor King was returning to his home in
Atlanta after a speech in Cleveland.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I
don't know. He probably wants to rest."</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Ah,
come on. Let's go."</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Tom
and I stood and walked to the front of the plane. "Doctor King," I
said, "I just want to tell you that we really admire what you're doing
in the South. We're on our way to join the march."</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Wonderful,
wonderful, ah... Fathers, I presume. Catholic?"</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Tom
shook his hand and introduced himself and then me.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"How
are you Fathers getting to the march?"</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">This
surprised me. I expected a statement about the importance of his
efforts, but instead, he asked about our travel plans. I explained<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>how we were going from Atlanta to Selma by
air, but we hadn't figured out how we'd get to the march.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Here,"
he said, and wrote something on a piece of paper. "The white cab
companies in Selma won't help you, but this company will. It's owned by
blacks. Use my name."</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">We
thanked him and wished him well.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="text-indent: 15px; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Well,
God bless you, Fathers. I'm going to spend a little time with my family
and I'll rejoin the march tomorrow."</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"

went back to our seats, impressed by a great man who bothered himself

had always been taught that the bishop spoke for God. Could I tell him
that Father Tom's pastor was one hundred percent behind him and had the
people of the parish praying for his safety? My pastor listened to
every racist who knocked on the door and soothed them with, "I know, I
know. I'm going to get rid of him."</p>

support. "I tell you, Father, normally I leave a new priest in a parish
for five years, but I'm going to move you now into the inner city. You
like working with the black people, don't you, Father?"</p>

windows of the church to get some fresh air in. But the trouble is, I
can't get the windows closed. And those courses I took at the
university &ndash; they have me questioning everything. I used to think
the Catholic Church was the true church, now I think all churches are

Suddenly the whole drama flashed into my mind. Here was the good mother
rescuing her errant son from the devil streets of the city. Here was
the good Catholic mother bringing her wandering child back to Mother
Church.</p>

      </span>In that instant, I grew up. I broke away from the concept
of <i style="">son-hood</i> that my mother and the church had
instilled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This woman was special for me,
she had raised me, but she no longer had any say in my life. Polite
conversation would replace honesty from then on..</p>

I returned to my life.</p>

      </span>"Hi, Mom," I said into the phone, my future wife, Kathy,
standing right next to me. I met her one night in April when I went to

1983<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent2"
 style="text-indent: 25px; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In
1983, at the age of forty-seven, I discovered creative writing. It
changed my life. I would sit down at the typewriter after supper and
follow my creative muse. Whole worlds opened to me. I wrote about the
space behind my childhood garage where I practiced pitching and dreamed
of reaching the major leagues. I wrote a short story about a group of
prisoners on an island. I wrote a poem about getting along with the
Russians. Hours passed. Suddenly, as I wrote, an alarm would ring in
the house. My wife and I owned a commercial greenhouse outside
Milwaukee, Wisconsin, a ma-and-pa operation. The alarm meant I hadn't
turned the heat on. I had to shut the door on the vibrant world that
grew on the paper in front of me and hurry to the greenhouses to start
the furnaces.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="text-indent: 25px; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">An
hour later I'd be back at the typewriter. Type a sentence, stop, look
at it, realize it wasn't quite true and then search deeper, ever
deeper. Layers of middle-aged half-truths disappeared, the comfortable
maxims I had surrounded myself with &ndash; "Business is good. Don't
make any changes" and "Relax. You're getting older." The fires of my
youth burned again &ndash; civil rights, world peace, a place in the
sun for every person. I was a Catholic priest as a young man, filled
with idealism. I marched in Selma with Doctor King, picketed local
companies to give jobs to blacks, and confronted my own bishop over the
church's institutional racism.</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent2"
 style="text-indent: 25px; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As I
wrote, I dug, I searched, always deeper, ever more honest. It might be
easy to speak a lie, but it wasn't easy to write one. I started to
unravel the tangled skein that was me. These revelations came, not from
writing philosophy or self-help dictums, but from writing fiction. Put
a man and a woman in a fictional situation. What does the woman really
think? What does the man think? Is this real? Is this how people are?
Where do I get my ideas? What is human nature all about?</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="text-indent: 25px; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">What a
wonderful gift this was. How great it would be to give it to others. My
creative writing instructor at Marquette University asked me to
substitute for him one evening. My peers gave me positive feedback and
I looked around for a place to teach. I had enough credentials to fill
a wall, (a master's degree, five years as a Catholic priest, and four
years as a city councilman) but no writing testimonials, such as a book
or an article in a status magazine.</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent2"
 style="text-indent: 25px; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Who
would have me as a writing instructor? I was just a beginner myself.
Around this time the State of Wisconsin called for more volunteers to
help reintegrate prisoners into society. Yes, that was it, I'd
volunteer to teach in prison. I'd show the men that writing could melt
the bars around their souls. Besides, prisons cried for reform. As a
priest I'd visited a few penitentiaries and found them terribly
inhumane &ndash; men locked in cages. In my opinion they were just
warehouses. Men's lives were not changed. Instead they learned how to
do crime better.</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent2"
 style="text-indent: 25px; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">I had
read <i>Papillon</i>, the story of Henri Charri&eacute;re's terrible
experience in prison and his struggle to be true to himself. The book
moved me deeply.</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent2"
 style="text-indent: 25px; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Perhaps
I could teach the men to write like Papillon or the Russian,
Solzhenitsyn. Then, like these mentors, they would tell the world about
the dystopia they lived in. In a larger sense, the bars would melt away.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="text-indent: 25px; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">I told
my wife, Kathy, about my plan. "Why prison?" she asked. "Why not help
Jimmy Carter build houses for poor people?"</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="text-indent: 25px; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>Good question. I didn't know the answer. I was
silent.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="text-indent: 25px; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She
touched my arm. "I will worry about you."</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="text-indent: 25px; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I
know," I said and hugged her.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="text-indent: 25px; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"We
have it good now. Money, health, two great children."</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent2"
 style="text-indent: 25px; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I
know. I know, but &hellip; I have to go."</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent2"
 style="text-indent: 25px; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">My
friends weren't impressed either. "Psychological need to help others."
"Just going to get good stories." "They don't need creative writing
&ndash; they need basic English and spelling." "Why waste your time on
scumbags?"</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent2"
 style="text-indent: 25px; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">I
ignored everyone's advice and wrote to the warden of the toughest
prison in Wisconsin, the maximum-security facility at Waupun. The
prison's director of education approved my plan and I was slated to
start that September.</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent3"
 style="line-height: normal; text-indent: 25px; margin-left: 0in; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">This
is the story of my prison journeys in the USA and in Canada. It's a
record of success and failure, of finding myself as I helped others
find themselves. I began like Joshua outside Jericho. All I had to do
was sound the horn, the men would pick up their pens and the walls
would come tumbling down.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="text-indent: 25px; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">That
isn't what happened.</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent"
 style="text-indent: 25px; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
 style="font-style: normal;">When I stopped blowing the horn, I heard
words uttered in the stillness. They were words of power that demanded
change of me. The words smolder in every corner of every prison,
waiting to catch fire in the soul of every passing guard, official or
convict. <o:p> </o:p> </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="text-indent: 25px; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">I
learned the words from the people you will meet in this book.</p>
