      <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent3"
 style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">I'd always dreamt of
being a rock star. It seemed like the perfect life for me. Sleep in
every morning and stay up all night. Who wouldn't love that sort of job?</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;">I stood at the storefront window, staring in
at the rock and roll display. My longhaired icons posed in sultry
formations for the camera. They were my idols. I loved the music, and
even though I already had one lucky <i style="">Guns and Roses</i> tee
shirt, I wanted another. <o:p> </o:p> </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;">On the walk back to my foster home, the
wheels in my brain spun recklessly. I could break into a hundred cars
before getting enough spare change together to buy the new album or a
new tee shirt. I needed a bigger caper.<o:p> </o:p> </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;">When I returned to the foster home, both my
&lsquo;parents' were gone. I went directly to their bedroom, which they
usually locked, but this time was open.<o:p> </o:p> </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;">I searched their drawers and closet for
money. They were keen to my little thieving problem, so they hid their
stuff well.<o:p> </o:p> </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;">Not that well.<o:p> </o:p> </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;">I had never committed a cheque fraud before,
but age thirteen seemed like a good time to start. In the top drawer, I
found a cheque written out to my foster dad for two hundred dollars. I
knew that I'd need identification in his name to cash it. After sifting
through a small pile of I.D., I found his sailing club card tucked
underneath a stack of boxer shorts. <o:p> </o:p> </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;">I knew that I would have to be confident and
assume the identity of my foster dad to pull it off. I remembered a
cheque I received a year ago from an elderly lady for some lawn work.
She had written <i style="">Good Job Mike!</i> on the face of the
cheque. I'd cashed that cheque without any sort of I.D., so I wondered
if that would work again.<o:p> </o:p> </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;">In the bank, the teller smiled down at me
from behind the counter. She scanned the cheque, then my innocent face.
I made sure I bent my knees while standing at the counter so that I
would appear smaller than I really was. <o:p> </o:p> </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;">"What sort of work was this for, Ray?" she
asked me in a proud motherly tone.<o:p> </o:p> </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;">"Yard work," I said. "I want to buy my mom a
birthday gift."<o:p> </o:p> </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;">"Hold on a minute," she said and disappeared
with my cheque.<o:p> </o:p> </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;">That was the moment I learned something
important about crime. There is no such thing as a halfway crook. If
you embark on a criminal mission, you must stay to the end if you want
to succeed. I felt like running out of that bank the minute she left to
speak with her manager, but the thrill of succeeding at my first major
crime kept me planted to the floor. <o:p> </o:p> </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;">When she returned, the warm smile contained a
touch of doubt. My heart pounded in my chest.<o:p> </o:p> </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;">"Okay Ray, I can't cash this for you unless
you have some sort of identification."<o:p> </o:p> </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;">My criminal mind had not yet been groomed for
any sort of fraud, so I can't explain how I understood my next move. I
reached into my pocket and produced Ray's wallet. I removed the sailing
club card and slid it across the counter to the woman. She picked up
the I.D. and read the name. <o:p> </o:p> </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;">"Is this all you have?" she asked.<o:p> </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;">"I'm only thirteen," I said. "I'm waiting for
my driver's license. It should be here in a few years."<o:p> </o:p> </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;">The woman laughed and slid my I.D. back to
me. <o:p> </o:p> </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;">"Well, that's definitely I.D.," she said with
that warm smile. "How do you want the money?"</span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span

      </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">I've sat in a dozen
principal's offices in my life. The sure events that got you a seat in
the main man's office were fighting, yelling at teachers and acting the
clown in class. <o:p> </o:p> </span></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent3"
 style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The chair next to the
door in Mr. Macdonald's office was a familiar spot for me. I'd sat
there at least ten times before the first break in the school year,
probably a school record. His office was eerily similar to every other
one I'd been in. Four white walls with little or no sign of creative
inclination towards the decorating, the same school issue desk and
chair, and a bookshelf filled with management guides and personal
reading material. Principals were so boring. From my time spent in
their offices, I'd have to say that they were all created from the same
mold, and that was a shame, because the mold had gone out of style a
long time ago.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;">I wasn't like most disciplinary cases. My
mold had been broken the day I was born. <o:p> </o:p> </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;">As I waited for Mr. Macdonald to return to
his office, my mind began to wander. My criminal tendencies took over.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>Ten seconds to search his desk, five seconds
in travel time from the chair to his chair. Twenty seconds in all it
would take to find something to steal. The game was on. I noticed his
jacket hanging from a hook on the back of the door.<span style=""> </span>Later,
in the playground across the street from my school &ndash; ex-school
&ndash; I sat on the bottom part of the slide and removed the brown
leather wallet from my crotch. Inside, I learned more about Mr.
Macdonald's life. He had twenty dollars and a variety of food coupons
in the money compartment and pictures of his family and his I.D. in
another section. <o:p> </o:p> </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;">I removed his credit card and smiled.<o:p> </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;">I'd never done credit card fraud, but at that
moment in time, I had nothing else to do with my life. Since Mr.
Macdonald felt the need to expel me from his school, he had a lesson of
his own to learn, and I would be the teacher. <o:p> </o:p> </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;">I felt comfortable with crime. The business
of thieving had me hooked. Who needed school when there was so much
more to learn on the streets? <o:p> </o:p> </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;">I took the money and credit card and tossed
the remainder of the wallet's contents into the garbage.&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span

      <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent3"
 style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The yellow Datsun
screeched around the corner, narrowly missing several parked cars. My
foot was an extension of the accelerator. The automatic transmission of
the stolen car ground away as I alternated from brake to gas.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;">"Slow down," screamed my friend Dallas from
the passenger seat. He held on to the door as the car fishtailed around
another corner.<o:p> </o:p> </span></p>

 style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>Easter gifts for our girlfriends cluttered the back seat.
Baskets of chocolate eggs and stuffed bunnies slid from side to side as
the car recklessly spun its wheels around soft bends in the road. <o:p>
      </o:p> </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>Into a residential neighborhood we sped. Past manicured
lawns and driveways with basketball hoops. These were the neighborhoods
I targeted for my break-ins &ndash; the homes that I stole from to buy
the goods in the back seat. This was the kind of neighborhood I had
stolen the car from. The kind neighborhood that had unlocked back doors
and open ground floor windows &ndash; all potential victims of my
dishonest tirade.<o:p> </o:p> </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>The back end of the Datsun bumped a parked pickup truck.<o:p>
      </o:p> </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>Dallas's knuckles glowed white against the tan leather of
the door inlay. "You should let me drive." <o:p> </o:p> </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>"One more turn," I said, and pressed down on the gas.<o:p>
      </o:p> </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>The hairpin turn came out of nowhere. I saw the oak tree
on the front lawn, the elderly woman watering her flowers, the two
young kids playing in a ditch across the street. I knew we were going
too fast. I slammed my left foot down on the brake, at the same time
pressing on the accelerator with my right. <o:p> </o:p> </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

dashboard in front of him.<o:p> </o:p> </span></p>

 style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>I lost control of the car. The wheel jerked from my hand
and the last thing I remember was how quickly the oak tree appeared in
front of my face.<o:p> </o:p> </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>I crashed the car and made it out alive. That was my first
trip to Juvenile Hall.</span></p>

      <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent3"
 style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">I removed the bottle of
Ritalin from my pocket and showed it to Stevie. His eyes lit up with
dollar signs and he snatched it from my hand.</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText"
 style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>"There's enough here to get at least a gram of weed," he
said, and snapped the lid back on the bottle.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

 style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>Stevie tucked the bottle into his windbreaker pocket.
"Trust me. Those guys eat these up like they're Smarties."<o:p> </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>It seemed that whenever I moved to a new foster home,
along with it came a new school and a new medication. I'd always
thought the Ritalin was for kids who couldn't pay attention in class
&ndash; at least that's what my foster mom told me. Ritalin was the
latest attempt at settling me down in class, but it wasn't until I met
Stevie that I realized what they were really good for. I listened to
him because he was older than me, and had taken way more medication
than I could ever imagine.<o:p> </o:p> </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span

the high school. "They make you more stupid than they do smart."<o:p> </o:p>

      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;">Stevie told me three days ago that he had a
guy in the high school that bought all of his Ritalin, and that it had
been nearly two months since he had actually swallowed a pill. He'd
perfected the art of concealing his morning application under his
tongue, quickly expelling it behind his parent's back and saving them
until he had enough to bring to his high school connection. <o:p> </o:p>

for us near the bike rack, just as Stevie had promised. The kids were
much bigger than we were. When they saw us approaching, I noticed one
search the area before taking any steps towards us. They acknowledged
Stevie with a nod.<o:p> </o:p> </span></p>

Two grams."<o:p> </o:p> </span></p>

      </span>Stevie knew all the lingo when it came to dealing with
drug dealers. I'd gone with him several times downtown to buy weed,
which we'd smoke and ditch school in favor of doing break and enters in
people's homes.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span

      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span

less."<o:p> </o:p> </span></p>

 style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>They walked away from us without another word. I stood
staring at Stevie, shocked by what had just occurred. Stevie remained
silent and his chin dipped into his chest.<o:p> </o:p> </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>"What just happened, Stevie?" I asked with a slight trace
of panic.<o:p> </o:p> </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      </span>Stevie turned to walk away from the bike rack, but I
didn't budge. They just took my entire supply of Ritalin and gave us
nothing in return. Stevie promised that we would get something from
these guys. That was the only reason why I had stolen the stuff in the
first place. I watched Stevie walk one way, and the high schoolers the
other. I was not about to get ripped off.</p>

to us. Stevie stopped and stared at me. His eyes wide with fear. I
stood my ground, facing the three giants</span>.<span

 style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>The biggest boy laughed amongst his friends and walked
slowly back to me. He tossed his cigarette to the ground and spat at my
feet.<o:p> </o:p> </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

eye. "You owe us some weed."<o:p> </o:p> </span></p>

      </span><span style="">&nbsp;</span>I wasn't a small kid, just
undersized compared to the teenager, but I had heart. Without another
word I lunged out at the kid, punching him square in the nose. His face
exploded, covering my shirt with his blood. As he fell to the ground, I
continued to throw punches, hitting whatever I could in the process.
His screams for help escaped from underneath me, but his friends stood
by watching, shocked at my violent reaction.<o:p> </o:p> </span></p>

      </span>The bottle of Ritalin fell from his pocket, and like a
good sidekick, Stevie pounced on it and ran away. <o:p> </o:p> </span></p>

 style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>After two minutes of fighting, I stood, his blood all over
my hands and clothes. He whimpered on the ground as his friends came
over to help him up. They ran off in the direction of the school, away
from the crazy young drop-out with the unfortunate combination of
attention deficit disorder and violent tendencies.<o:p> </o:p> </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>"You're fucking crazy," said Stevie. He slammed the bottle
of Ritalin in my hand. "These are yours. We're dead once that guy gets
better."<o:p> </o:p> </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>I looked at the bottle in my hand. The kid's blood stained
everything from my coat sleeves to my pant cuffs. That was the first
beating I'd ever been on the winning side of, and it felt good, even
though my hand was swollen from punching the ground more times than his
head. <o:p> </o:p> </span></p>

      </span>Inside the basement suite of the old, two-story Victorian
home, I noticed the wallpaper was made of bamboo. A throwback from the
Eighties, the coarse overlay summed up the personality of my grade
eleven teacher, Mr. Martz. Bad taste and out of touch.<o:p> </o:p> </span></p>

Joey at the time. I twirled in the chair, watching the outdated living
room spin around and around. The haunting memories of a generation past
melded into one continuous blur, until finally a hairy hand on the
headrest ended my ride. The cool eyes of our teacher warned me of
unwanted horseplay in his home.<o:p> </o:p> </span></p>

my mouth shut.<o:p> </o:p> </span></p>

 style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

 style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>Martz didn't laugh along with me. "You're too young to
drink," he said and he got up and gave Joey a can of pop. Then he
reached into a cabinet under the surface of the coffee table in front
of him.<o:p> </o:p> </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>Martz lit a cigarette. "How much do you guys need to get
started? Remember, you'll have to pay me later." <o:p> </o:p> </span></p>

 style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>On the table in front of Martz was a ziplock bag filled
with bright green marijuana. The two entities didn't match. My teacher
and illegal weed. Just months before, I had been busted with weed in my
locker. I was threatened with suspension if I didn't tell the police
where I got my stuff. I kept my mouth shut, and the school had no
choice but to suspend me for two days. <o:p> </o:p> </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>Now I was buying weed from them. That kind of stuff messed
with a boy's mind.<o:p> </o:p> </span></p>

 style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>"Two ounces," said Joey from the cabinet. He poured more
alcohol into two low tumblers. <o:p> </o:p> </span></p>

 style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>"Do that many kids smoke?" Martz asked. He opened the
ziplock and pulled out a handful of the green bud.<o:p> </o:p> </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

"But downtown, too."<o:p> </o:p> </span></p>

 style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

 style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>"You shouldn't go downtown," he scolded me as he dropped
the handful of weed onto a set of scales. "There are some fucked up
people downtown."<o:p> </o:p> </span></p>

      </span>Mr. Martz was led out of the school in handcuffs four days
after we'd bought the weed from him. In front of the entire gym class,
the police stuffed him into a squad car and we never saw him again. My
final image of the <i style="">teacher</i> Mr. Martz was a wink in my
direction. <o:p> </o:p> </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;">His secret was safe with me. I wouldn't tell
a soul about his dealings. He was a drug dealer, and from everything
I'd learned about guys like him, it didn't matter what they did as
their job, they would all mess you up if you even spoke their name in
front of the police. I liked Mr. Martz, but it wasn't until I bought
weed from him downtown years later that I realized he had become one of
those fucked up people he warned me of.<o:p> </o:p> </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>After that gym class, I headed directly to my locker. My
hands shook as I fumbled with the lock, opening it to find the two
ounces of weed I'd bought from Martz still hidden in my jacket pocket.
Since the teacher was gone, the weed was now free. Joey would be happy
for the sudden boost in our economy. Because of Martz's carelessness,
we were on the fast track to mini retirement. I grabbed my jacket and
slammed my locker door closed. School had worn out its necessity.<o:p> </o:p>

      </span>We called it crack corner because it was the only place in
the city you could find a real live crack-head. It was a grungy section
of downtown, consumed by irregular traffic patterns and pedestrians
seldom found in suburban areas of any city. Garbage and evidence of
drug activity littered the sidewalks for more than two blocks, but the
corner was the worst. It was a dangerous spot for anyone not involved
somehow in the drug subculture, so few <i style="">normal</i> people
ventured to that section of the downtown district. <o:p> </o:p> </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      </span>A yellow line in the middle of the road separated the
illegal merchants from the respectable ones. When a drug dealer
conducted sales on that corner, the people across the street watched
with disgust. It was as if a spotlight was shining directly down on the
dealer from heaven, illuminating his evil plans to corrupt poor souls
further into a life of despair. They watched with disdain as hobbled,
broken down humans leeched their way to the corner, welfare money in
their pockets, to buy small amounts of marked up drugs to satisfy the
demons inside.<o:p> </o:p> </span></p>

      </span>Many times I stood on that street corner wondering who
looked worse &ndash; the addicts or the dealers. At any time of the day
my mouth was filled with half-gram spitballs of cocaine. The spitballs
consisted of the drug wrapped tightly in condoms, and were no bigger
than a peanut. The latex prevented them from breaking open in case I
had to <i style="">swallow</i> if an undercover decided to jump me.
The packaging job was the most important part of the entire drug
dealing operation. <o:p> </o:p> </span></p>

      </span>At night, the wind chilled our bodies and the job froze
our souls. The corner was an all around <i style="">cold</i> place to
spend your time, and all forms of <i style="">heat</i> were the issue
at any point of time. The night air lacked heat. The pressure to sell
more than the other dealers made the competition hot. The cops who
patrolled the corner were the hottest of all, so hot, we couldn't stand
too close or we'd get burned. <o:p> </o:p> </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;">When Joey arrived at the corner with a hot
chocolate from <i style="">Seven-Eleven</i> for both of us, he had a
crooked smile on his face, the kind he had any time he had just done
something bad.<o:p> </o:p> </span></p>

      </span>At two-thirty in the morning, there was a lot to see
downtown. The corner became a main meeting place for dope fiends and
dealers. Fights broke out. Pimps would drive by looking for their
wayward girls. Patrol cars cruised the strip where the nightclubs were,
up past the prostitutes on the stroll, ending at the corner, where they
took notes and pictures of the who's who and what's what. At
two-thirty, life forms were no more than immoral bags of skin drained
of hope and direction. <o:p> </o:p> </span></p>

      </span>Joey led me to a covered bus stop on the bar strip. He
laughed out loud and pointed to a man on the ground, asleep and snoring
as if he were drunk. In his hand was a single flower &ndash; carnation
maybe. A long thread of drool hung from the corner of his mouth,
touching the dirty concrete. A drunken mess.<o:p> </o:p> </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>"Let's beat the shit out of him," said Joey. He tipped his
cup and poured a portion of his hot chocolate on the drunk. "He
deserves it anyway."<o:p> </o:p> </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>I stuffed my free hand in my pocket. It was too cold to do
any sort of beating that night. We'd been on the street since seven
that evening. I was hungry. My head hurt from carrying the spitballs in
my cheeks the entire night. I was envious of the drunk's ability to
just let go and fall asleep. <o:p> </o:p> </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>"Let's just leave him alone and go home," I said. "This
place is dead anyway."<o:p> </o:p> </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>Joey poured the remainder of his chocolate on the man who
didn't move. The steam from the drink fizzled in the air. Joey threw
the cup at the drunk's head. <o:p> </o:p> </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>"We should at least rob him," Joey crouched down to search
the guy. "Teach him a lesson for falling asleep in the street."<o:p> </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>Joey unloaded each of the man's pockets. I stood over him,
scanning the streets for witnesses to our unethical crime. He tossed a
nylon wallet up at me. I held it in my hand for a few seconds, shocked
that the guy still had some portion of his sober life attached. <o:p> </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>"What's in the wallet?" Joey asked as he stood up. "He's
got nothing else."<o:p> </o:p> </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>I looked in the wallet. "Fifteen bucks."<o:p> </o:p> </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>Joey smiled. "Cab fare." Spits on the guy. "Fucking bum."<o:p>
      </o:p> </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>We left the poor bastard in the bus stop and ventured back
to the corner for one last attempt at relieving our jowls of the spits.
As soon as we arrived, we were confronted by one of the most nervous
junkies I'd ever seen. He stood in our spotlight, hopping from foot to
foot to stay warm, scanning the corner for any sign of a dealer. When
he saw us coming, his eyes lit up like a video poker machine. <i
 style="">Jackpot!</i><o:p> </o:p> </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>"You guys holding?" he licked his lips repeatedly as he
spoke. <o:p> </o:p> </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>Joey gave me a look, and nodded.<o:p> </o:p> </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>"Sure," I said. "What do you want?"<o:p> </o:p> </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>Rule number one was that you never made the transaction
directly on the corner. There was always a back alley or a side street
away from the corner in which I could conduct my deals. Joey remained
behind on the corner as I followed the junkie about a block away into a
small pedestrian alley between two business buildings.<o:p> </o:p> </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>"Let's make this quick," I said. "What do you want?"<o:p> </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>The next moment caught me by surprise. I'd never been
robbed before. I was always the quick one out of Joey and I. We were
sixteen-year-old kids dealing with thirty-year-old druggies. Quick feet
meant less trouble. Most of the time we never had a problem dealing to
people, but we knew the danger involved with the game. I made the
mistake of walking in a dark alley without Joey with me. It was too
late at night. My brain wasn't functioning correctly. When the second
junkie punched me from behind, I was lucky that I didn't lose my teeth
along with the mouthful of spits. The thunderous punch disoriented me
for a few minutes, just long enough for the fumbling junkies to pick up
the spits as they rolled out of my bleeding mouth. They danced in
silent confusion in front of my face. I tried to press my body up off
the ground, but all my strength was gone. The long hours in the cold
had paralyzed me. The urge to fight back was nowhere in my body. My
head felt like a waterlogged blanket. The unseen junky picked my head
up off the ground and squeezed my cheeks with his dirty hands. I
couldn't see his face, the only thing I remembered was the smell of his
body odor. I was completely vulnerable for the first time in my life. <o:p>
      </o:p> </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>After squeezing the remainder of the spits out of my
mouth, he slammed my head down onto the cement. I lay helpless,
listening to the two junkies talk between each other.<o:p> </o:p> </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>"Is that all of them?"<o:p> </o:p> </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>"I think so. What should we do with him?"<o:p> </o:p> </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>"Fuck him up. He'll come back to find me."<o:p> </o:p> </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>"He's just a kid. Fuck him. Let's go."<o:p> </o:p> </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

 style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

 style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>I remember the sudden flow of warmth I felt inside when
the footsteps of my assailants drifted off into the city night. The
relief that I was still alive gave me the most comfort I'd felt in
days, there on the dirty ground of what could have been my last stand. <o:p>
      </o:p> </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>The next night, I was back on the corner with a mouth full
of spitballs, and a syringe filled with toilet bowl cleaner. I was
going to find those junkies, and they were going to learn that they
should never let a beaten man back up on his feet.<o:p> </o:p> </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span

      </span>The most disturbing sight I've ever seen was the time I
watched a junkie shoot cocaine into his eye. Louie, a strung-out fifty
something junkie, gingerly pulled down the heavy black bag under his
eye and inserted the tip of the needle into what looked to be a vein
protruding from the eye ball. His hands were steady for a compulsive
junkie. He'd done the operation a hundred &ndash; probably a thousand
&ndash; times before, but this was the first time in my life I'd ever
witnessed something like this. Every movement was methodical.<o:p> </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"
 style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;">All I knew about Louis was that he bought at
least a half-ounce of cocaine from me a day, he was going blind, and he
didn't have a functional vein left in his body. He'd gone through the
gambit of injections sites on his deteriorating body &ndash; arms,
feet, penis &ndash; but just as quick as his time on earth was running
out, so were his available points of entry. The eyeball was surely his <i
 style="">Hail Mary</i> of shooting spots.<o:p> </o:p> </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>He blinked his eye hard, once or ten times, before he
looked at me again. He smiled in an attempt to hide his embarrassment.
A tear crept out the side of his stoned eye and he swept it away as if
it didn't exist.<o:p> </o:p> </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>"Promise me son not to do the things I've done," he sang.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>He tucked his syringe into a black needle
case. A true professional. "You ever shoot?"<o:p> </o:p> </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>I shook my head. "Never had the inclination to. I'm in
love with the money."<o:p> </o:p> </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>Louie chuckled and leaned back in his chair. "So was I,
until I had too much of it. Guess every dealer has to spend it on
something."<o:p> </o:p> </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>Louie had spent his money on nothing <i style="">but</i>
drugs. His apartment left little to be desired with its holes in the
wall and streams of garbage along the floor. The one bedroom cubicle
reeked of sweat and moldy food, and his kitchen looked more like a
laboratory than a place of food preparation. The building was a
notorious drug complex in my city. Of the four hundred suites, dope
friends, drug dealers and prostitutes, occupied at least half of them.
I had set up shop in one of the apartments just down the hall from
Louie. The apartment took me off the streets at night. It gave me
somewhere to live besides hotels and other people's couches, but it
mostly served as a convenient office space.<o:p> </o:p> </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>Louie was a harmless guy, until it came to dealing with
drugs. He had a hunger for the stuff that I'd never seen before. Every
time I arrived at his apartment, he always opened the door in complete
silence, and not a word was spoken out of context. We had an
understanding that there was no need for small talk. Strictly business.
He wanted the stuff, I wanted the money. <o:p> </o:p> </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>Louie was a lonely guy; I could sense that every time I
came over. There were no photos of family or friends hung on the wall
or on a shelf. I wondered how a fifty-something man remained alive
after years of shooting dope into his eye and living in filth and
solitude. I spent a few minutes after every sale with him, talking
about sports or, of all other things, the business of cocaine. I felt
embarrassed coming over just to deliver drugs, contributing to his
misery. Though we had little to talk about, we were sort of friends
with literally nothing in common besides our individual fondness for
dope. <o:p> </o:p> </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>Louie reached over and grabbed hold of my arm with old-man
strength. With the stoned eye shut, he scanned the flesh between my
biceps and forearm. He smiled and nodded his head.<o:p> </o:p> </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>"You got a nice one there." He traced a steady finger down
the main vein in my arm. "God, I'd like to bang that when you're ready."<o:p>
      </o:p> </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>I yanked my arm away. "What the hell's wrong with you?"<o:p>
      </o:p> </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>Louie laughed and sat back in his rickety dining room
chair. He closed his good eye and laughed to himself through his
clenched jaw. <o:p> </o:p> </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>"I gotta go, Lou," I said and tucked the crumpled up bills
into my pocket. "Call me later."<o:p> </o:p> </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>As soon as I made a move to the door, the entire apartment
filled with an aggressive pounding from out in the hall. I froze,
instantly thinking of the police. The bang sounded on the door. I
glanced over at Louie, whose stoned eye was open now and aware.<o:p> </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>"Who is it?" asked Louie, concealing his pathetic stoned
voice.<o:p> </o:p> </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>"Open the fucking door, Lou." It was Mariano.<o:p> </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>Mariano was a drug dealer's worst nightmare. He stood
about six foot five and weighed no less than two hundred and fifty. How
a cocaine addict managed to hold onto that sort of bodyweight always
astounded me. Mariano liked his drugs as much as Louie, only he didn't
like to pay for them. He was famous for beating the hell out of young
dealers for small amounts of drugs. A week before, he had stabbed one
of my friends in broad daylight on the corner for a spitball. The guy
was insane, and I was in big trouble if he caught me in Louie's
apartment.<o:p> </o:p> </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>I scrambled for a place to hide. "Louie," I pleaded. "Hide
me."<o:p> </o:p> </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>Louie fumbled to his feet, tucking the leather case into
the waistband of his pants.<o:p> </o:p> </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>"Hide in the shower." He pointed to a door next to the
kitchen. "That fucker doesn't bath. He won't find you there."<o:p> </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>I bolted into the washroom, quietly closing the door
behind me. The room was cluttered with more garbage; used q-tips
littered the counter. Empty bottles of over the counter medication and
crumpled up balls of bloody toilet paper overflowed the garbage can in
the corner. I peeled back the sticky black shower curtain and hid in
the tub, popping the additional three grams of cocaine I stupidly
brought with me into my mouth, ready to swallow to save my life from
Mariano. <o:p> </o:p> </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>Everyone in the city knew that Mariano would kill you for
drugs. Getting busted by the police was far better than having to deal
with him. At least the police only took you to jail. This guy dragged
you to hell, showed you the sights, then brought you back to Earth
wishing you had jumped in the lake of fire instead.<o:p> </o:p> </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>From my hiding spot, I heard Louie open the door to the
apartment. In a second, Mariano's voice filled the room.<o:p> </o:p> </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      </span>He was overly aggressive with people &ndash; which was one
of the reasons no one wanted to be around him. He stole from anyone,
and he had a reputation of ruining people's highs when he came around
by beating them up. The worse thing about cocaine was that it made you
paranoid. You thought about things that would be considered irrational.
A cocaine junkie lived in an entirely different world than the rest of
humanity. Everything focussed on getting drugs, doing drugs and living
through the times when there weren't any drugs around. Mariano couldn't
do either of those things without some sort of violence involved.<o:p> </o:p>

 style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>I prayed to the Lord I only visited in tight situations.
For the first time, I was really scared for my life. I'd dealt with so
many junkies, but none compared to Mariano. My entire professional
career I'd avoided him. He knew who I was, and I sometimes wondered if
he considered the fact that he had never gotten the chance to rob me. I
understood that trouble had a way of eventually catching up to you in
the seedy world of drug dealing. No dealer could ever go an entire
career without having to deal with a psychopath customer. I hoped that
day wasn't my turn. <o:p> </o:p> </span></p>

the washroom burst open. <o:p> </o:p> </span></p>

 style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>I remained still behind the dark curtain. The spitballs in
my mouth swelled to the size of Ping-Pong balls. I worried that I
wouldn't be able to swallow if Mariano wrapped his massive hands around
my throat. <o:p> </o:p> </span></p>

      </span>Cornered in that bathtub I realized that being the dealer
wasn't exactly the strongest position to be in. We were really just
pawns in the addict's game. The expendable energy source. If one of us
dropped, another would take our place. <o:p> </o:p> </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span

      </span>We called him <i style="">Rack</i> because of his
unbelievable talent to shoot pool. He could have made money on a
pro-tour somewhere in the world, but he decided to waste his life
dealing instead. Rack didn't look like a typical drug dealer. His curly
blond hair and athletic good looks allowed him to fit in wherever he
went. He seemed more like a college boy than a killer, but I knew he
was no scholar. He had a twisted side to him that made him react
differently to stressful situations. At that point in time, he was in
the most stressful of situations. He'd robbed several dealers in the
city, and foolish me, I thought I was different. I agreed to meet him
to sell him a kilogram of cocaine. I didn't actually believe that he
would rob me since we went back years, but as usual, the game always
seemed to change when you least expected it.<o:p> </o:p> </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>"Sorry, Mike," he said and tucked the kilo package into
his jacket. "If it makes you feel any better, I'm going to pay you
back."<o:p> </o:p> </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>I shook my head and looked away from him. Getting robbed
is the worst feeling in the world. It's not the robbery that makes a
man feel like shit, but the degradation of the event and the loss of
manhood that comes with swallowing your pride.<o:p> </o:p> </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>Rack left my car and left me thirty thousand dollars in
debt to my guy. I was devastated, and I'd be a liar if the thought of
killing Rack didn't cross my mind.<o:p> </o:p> </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span

      </span>Two weeks later I woke up to the ring of my building's
intercom system. I had a snub nose .38 in my hand as I opened the door
to find Rack's smiling mug. He had black bags under his eyes and looked
as though he hadn't slept in days. With little emotion, he tossed a red
backpack with a Spiderman emblem on the face onto the floor at my feet.<o:p>
      </o:p> </span></p>

      </span>When my best friend at that time, Dwayne, showed up at my
door with two brand new hundred-dollar bills, I should have sensed
something was wrong. He'd owed me the money for cocaine for three
weeks. He worked a straight job, and there was no chance in the
foreseeable future in which he could pay me. His own words. We had been
close friends since my days of juvenile hall, only he'd grown up and

our customers, thus slowly taking our business out of the equation.
Morris was never one to take undercutting lightly. We tried to sell out

      </span>"Sit down, Jason," yelled one of the women.<o:p> </o:p> </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>But he kept moving.<o:p> </o:p> </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>He inched closer to me; his eyes focussed on mine. I made
the mistake of moving away from him. A sign of weakness. A sign that
maybe I wouldn't shoot. He sensed it and leapt at me, grabbing hold of
the gun with both hands. <o:p> </o:p> </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>The women screamed and bolted up from the couch. They
remained out of the picture as we struggled in the doorway of the
living room, then onto the floor. He managed to get on top of me. I
sensed my defeat as I used all my strength to push him off me, but when
I did, I monkey-kicked Jason across the floor. He slammed into a wall,
then lay on the floor wincing in pain.<o:p> </o:p> </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>"Blast his ass!" yelled Morris from the hallway.<o:p> </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>I pointed the gun at Jason. His eyes were red with anger
as he breathed heavily from the fight. I could feel sweat drip down my
back. I'd never shot anyone before in my life. This wasn't how things
were supposed to end up. We were just supposed to take his dope and
beat him and his crew. The idea of killing him never entered the
picture.<o:p> </o:p> </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>Until that moment.<o:p> </o:p> </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

 style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>I gripped the barrel of the shotgun with one hand and
wrapped my finger around the trigger. "You got the stuff?" I yelled
back at Morris.<o:p> </o:p> </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

 style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>I aimed the gun at Jason. "Next time I pull the trigger.

      </span>"There's got to be a better way to do this," I sighed as I
opened the third package of cocaine.<o:p> </o:p> </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>My new partner Marco and I had just mailed our latest
shipment of cocaine to Canada from Belize. We'd been doing it for the
past three months, never getting an entire shipment up in one piece,
but it was an easy gig at that time. The plan was simple, we'd buy the
cocaine in Belize, package it in air tight bundles so the dogs couldn't
smell it, then package it once more in wooden carvings and send it to
Canada marked <i style="">Fragile</i>. When it arrived, I'd open the
carvings with a chainsaw and remove the goods. Simple.<o:p> </o:p> </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>We sent it through one of the world's more famous courier
companies, tracking its movement on the Internet. Whenever a package
showed up in a city, the package handlers scanned it. The scan would
appear on their system, which was available to the public via on-line.
If at any time the package stopped for too long in one city, we would
usually write it off, considering the fact that most prepaid <i
 style="">Fragile</i> packages were the fastest ones to clear customs.
When the package arrived in Canada, the courier would call us on a
dummy phone to notify us that we could pick it up. Even that was risky.
If the cops knew that there were drugs in the carving, they could wait
until the moment we came to get it before arresting us. It was a
dangerous game, but very profitable.<o:p> </o:p> </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>"This is beginning to give me gray hair, Marco," I said as
I counted the packages. "We sent eight packs, we have three left, we've
lost five this time."<o:p> </o:p> </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>"What do you suggest?" he said. "This is paying pretty
well."<o:p> </o:p> </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>I stood up and stretched. "Sure. But the amount of drugs
we lose each time isn't worth the money. We need a big shipment. All at
once."<o:p> </o:p> </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>"How the hell are we going to do that?" he asked,
chuckling at me as he spoke.<o:p> </o:p> </span></p>

 style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>The one thing I'd learned throughout my career of drug
dealing was that if there was a desire to get this drug to people,
there was always a way. All we needed was a grander mode of
transportation.<o:p> </o:p> </span></p>

wood shavings up before my girl gets home."<o:p> </o:p> </span></p>
