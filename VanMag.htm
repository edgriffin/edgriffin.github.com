inmates a way out of the lives that led them to prison</p>
            <p class="text"><em>By Todd Parker</em></p>
            <p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="text">OVERHEAD, HARSH FLORESCENT lights shine
down on a horseshoe of standard-issue, collapsible tables. High, thin
windows show slices of sky, though nothing that might distract a
student&rsquo;s attention for long. The cement-block walls are painted
a bland beige. There&rsquo;s a big flip chart at the front of the room.
This might be a suburban high school, except for the guards outside the
door.<br>
            <br>
At the tables sit a dozen fidgety men in green parkas, faded jeans,
once-white T-shirts discoloured and stretched from use. They nurse
black coffee and finger cigarettes rolled from loose tobacco. They
range in age from early twenties to mid-fifties; some are long-haired,
unshaven and tattooed, others as clean-cut and rosy-cheeked as
high-school gym teachers. There are drug abusers here, dealers, at
least one killer. They&rsquo;re inmates at Matsqui medium-security
prison, here for their weekly creative writing class.<br>
            <br>
Ed Griffin teaches the class every Friday morning. Almost 71 years old,
white in the little close-cropped hair that remains on his head, a bit
shaky in the neck and fingers, he looks like the grandfather you wish
you saw more of. He&rsquo;s driven here from his modest home in Surrey.
When he arrives at the facility, he&rsquo;s greeted by guards with
shotguns. He passes chain-link fences topped with razor wire and is
scanned for metal objects and drugs. At security checkpoints he waits
for heavily reinforced doors to be opened. The class is held in an
activities center at the heart of the compound; beyond is the yard and
then the prison proper&mdash;a four-storey concrete bunker with cells
for more than 300 inmates. The place induces suppressed panic and
claustrophobia in many people, but Griffin looks forward to his Fridays
here.<br>
            <br>
He opens by calling for a volunteer to read something written since
last week&rsquo;s class. Chris, who celebrated his thirtieth birthday
after arriving at Matsqui in 2005, has been a regular in the class for
more than a year. His short black hair is spiked with gel. Before his
incarceration he was a business manager, a husband, and a father.
Thanks to methamphetamine, he became an addict, a dealer, and a thief.
In prison he&rsquo;s become a high-school graduate, an avid reader, a
passionate writer. He reads from the first chapter of his manuscript,
&ldquo;Broken Fences&rdquo;, a fictionalized rendition of his battle
with crystal meth. He&rsquo;s not worried that he&rsquo;ll be ridiculed
here&mdash;mutual respect is rule one.</p>

In the opening scene of the story, the protagonist is outside his own
home, which has been left a smoldering ruin: &ldquo;A cat, owl-eyed and
slightly singed, comes wandering out from the safety of a juniper.
That&rsquo;s my cat, Nash recalls, and feels a sliver of gratitude. But
he is unable to remember the cat&rsquo;s name.&rdquo; Later, asked why
he attends the class, Chris replies, &ldquo;Writing takes me out of
here. It&rsquo;s something other than drugs that I can imagine waiting
for me on the outside.&rdquo;This is the effect Griffin hopes to have
on his students, though it&rsquo;s not why, in 1985, already in his
late forties, he first taught in a prison.<br>
            <br>
His goal then was simply to spread the joy of writing, which he himself
had recently discovered, and his hope was that he might provide tonic
for a few worried souls. At Waupun, a pre-Civil War maximum security
prison in Wisconsin, the dull lighting, high-ceilinged halls with
yellowing paint, and foul odours made him question his decision.
Witnessing the brusque cavity search of an inmate made the idea seem
insane. In the first chapter of his own book-in-progress,
&ldquo;Dystopia,&rdquo; Griffin expresses the doubts he felt:
&ldquo;Maybe I just wanted to feel good, to tell people, &lsquo;Hey,
aren&rsquo;t I macho?&rsquo;&rdquo; But something an inmate said that
first day gave him the idea that he could perhaps accomplish something
of real significance. When Griffin asked the inmates why writing was
important to them, a young man named Brian replied, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
something they can&rsquo;t take away from us.&rdquo;</p>

                        <p class="text"><br>
Griffin was familiar with the desire to identify something essential to
self. As a young man raised in a Catholic family&mdash;his father, an
electrician, had been to seminary&mdash;he thought he&rsquo;d found it
in religion. Ordained a priest in his hometown of Cleveland, Ohio, at
the age of 27, Griffin was assigned to an affluent and conservative
parish in a predominantly white suburb. Inspired by the spirit of
reformation in the church encouraged by Pope John XXIII, and by the
civil rights movement gaining momentum under Martin Luther King Jr.,
Griffin felt it his duty to respond when King called for volunteers to
march at Selma in support of equal rights for minorities. His
parishioners did not agree. Griffin was called a nigger-lover and
reassigned to an inner-city parish. &ldquo;That was the beginning of my
end with the church,&rdquo; he says quietly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a very
painful part of my life.&rdquo;<br>
                        <br>
In three years Griffin saw lavish new churches built in rich white
neighbourhoods while he fought in vain for programs to help the poor in
his community. Though popular with his new parishioners, he found
himself increasingly at odds with the church. Five years into his
service, he left. &ldquo;My entire life was devoted to God,&rdquo; he
recalls. &ldquo;One day my identity was Father Ed, the next day I was
just Ed. I had no idea what that meant.&rdquo;<br>
                        <br>
It took years to find out. He remained active in the civil rights
movement. In 1970 he married Cathy Cremin, who was also very involved
in the movement, and before long they had a daughter and a son. Griffin
earned a master&rsquo;s in social work at the University of Wisconsin
and was elected to Milwaukee city council. He and his wife ran a
commercial greenhouse on the outskirts of the city. In 1985 he took a
continuing education course that gave his life new direction.
&ldquo;When I discovered writing, I found a way to touch the
divine,&rdquo; Griffin says. &ldquo;And when I entered a prison for the
first time, I found men who needed that kind of spirit in their
lives.&rdquo;ed up with the Republican reign in the States, Griffin
moved his family to Canada in 1988. Having been told that he was too
old (at 52) to be employable, and that he could emigrate only if he
started a business, he and Cathy opened a greenhouse in Cloverdale.
Soon Griffin began teaching creative writing for the Surrey School
Board. He started teaching as a volunteer at Matsqui in 1993, and was
hired in 1997. Aside from his work at the prison, he also helped found
the Surrey Writer&rsquo;s Conference, the largest of its kind in
Western Canada, and he teaches continuing education courses in English
as a second language.</p>

Griffin wants to do more than encourage artistic freedom in his
students: he aims to encourage a shift in prison thinking. By
imprisoning convicts, restricting personal freedoms, and processing
offenders through anger management and substance abuse programs, the
system is theoretically transforming them into law-abiding citizens (as
well as punishing them for their crimes). But at no point, Griffin
points out, is a prisoner asked what he thinks he needs to accomplish
his rehabilitation or encouraged to offer his views on the process. By
teaching inmates to think creatively, and by giving them the skills to
express themselves, he hopes to involve them in the debate on how
prisons work. At least they&rsquo;ll have creative outlets for the
frustration of being locked away.<br>
                        <br>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m giving these guys something else to do other than get
high, maybe something else to look forward to after they get
out,&rdquo; Griffin says. &ldquo;At the very least, I&rsquo;m giving
them a different way to consider the world.&rdquo;<br>
                        <br>
Griffin has written four novels himself, and published them through
Trafford, the Victoria-based print-on-demand house. Prisoners of the
Williwaw is about a future prison set on a remote island where the
inmates are left to fend for themselves. It grows out of
Griffin&rsquo;s belief that what will reform the criminal mind is not
deprivation of freedom but rather the assumption of personal
responsibility. When Griffin writes, he does not imagine John
Grisham-like fame and fortune for himself&mdash;he simply articulates
his vision of how the world could work. This accessing of one&rsquo;s
innermost thoughts and beliefs is what he means by touching the divine.<br>
                        </p>
                        <p class="text">All of Griffin&rsquo;s other
books, though fiction, verge on autobiography. <em>Beyond the Vows</em>
is set in the 1960s and tells the story of a young Catholic priest who
falls in love despite the vows he has taken. &ldquo;Dystopia&rdquo;
began as a narrative of alternating chapters, written with a prisoner
named Mike, that tells the story of his experiences as an outsider
entering prison, and Mike&rsquo;s insider impressions of him.<br>
                        <br>
Mike is 30, charismatic, and energetic. He attended Griffin&rsquo;s
classes every Friday morning when he was at Matsqui. &ldquo;I never
believed I could ever be anything other than a criminal,&rdquo; he
says. &ldquo;If you told me seven years ago that one day I&rsquo;d have
aspirations to become a writer, I would have tried to sell you
drugs.&rdquo; In the story of Mike&rsquo;s life, he is both the villain
and the hero. His troubles began almost a decade ago in a Mexican jail.
He had a plan: buy cheap drugs, smuggle them back to Canada, make big
money. When he and his partner were arrested, the partner fingered
Mike. The partner left Mexico; Mike spent years in a horrifying prison.
&ldquo;All I thought about was revenge and dealing more drugs,&rdquo;
he says. &ldquo;I never thought I could ever write a novel.&rdquo;</p>
                        <p class="text">Transferred to Canada through a
treaty arrangement, he met Griffin at Matsqui. He thought little of the
old defrocked priest at first. &ldquo;I figured he was crazy for coming
into prison to teach,&rdquo; Mike says. He was baffled by
Griffin&rsquo;s inability to see the futility of what he wanted to
accomplish. &ldquo;Convicts have a hard enough time changing their
clothes, never mind changing their way of thinking.&rdquo;</p>

But over time Griffin had a profound effect on Mike. The younger man
has developed the means to explore his anger, locate the source of his
self-destructive behaviour, and convert those emotions into words on
the page. Griffin has shown him the power of self-expression and the
divinity at the heart of introspection. &ldquo;Ed Griffin is a
superhero,&rdquo; Mike says. &ldquo;Able to overcome any obstacle in a
single bound. Able to break down the thickest walls in any
penitentiary. He saw right into my heart and helped me understand what
I need to be happy.&rdquo;<br>
                        <br>
Griffin has influenced many prisoners over the years. Rob is known for
his starring role in an RCMP bait car video, which shows him high on
crystal meth behind the wheel of a stolen pickup. At one time the most
successful car thief in the province, he was convicted and sent to
Matsqui in 2004. He overcame his addiction in prison. He also met
Griffin and was drawn to the idea of writing. Week after week, month
after month, he wrote about his life, a therapeutic journey. He&rsquo;s
almost ready to show a nonfiction manuscript about his life,
tentatively titled &ldquo;Oncoming,&rdquo; to publishers. In the spring
Griffin introduced Rob to agents at the Surrey Writer&rsquo;s
Conference (at least one of whom was offended that the ex-priest would
inflict an ex-con on her).<br>
                        <br>
Rob&rsquo;s prose is simple, almost childish. &ldquo;When I reached the
house,&rdquo; he writes in a chapter about his childhood, &ldquo;I
stood on a tire, climbed up and slid my bedroom window open. I
wasn&rsquo;t supposed to do this. My mother had made it clear to me
many times that I was to wait for Charlene to get home and unlock the
front door.&rdquo;<br>
                        <br>
Rob is out of prison now, living with a woman and her two children,
seemingly on the straight and narrow. But he&rsquo;s the exception.
Recidivism is rampant at Matsqui, as elsewhere; as many as 80 percent
of inmates are repeat offenders. Too many of Griffin&rsquo;s students
return to drug abuse and crime after their release. Still, the prospect
of helping even one in five deal with life on the outside is all the
motivation Griffin needs. Asked why he&rsquo;s committed to helping men
most people want nothing to do with, Ed Griffin smiles and rubs the
back of his neck. &ldquo;Hard to say. I still don&rsquo;t know exactly
what I hope to accomplish. I guess it&rsquo;s enough to know that these
guys can use my help.&rdquo;</p>
