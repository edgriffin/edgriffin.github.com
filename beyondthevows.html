      <p>Father JP Lacey throws himself into the priesthood after
twelve years in the seminary. The year is 1964. He's going to free the
captives and give sight to the blind as the prophet Isaiah has
directed. He hears confessions, chaplains parish groups and struggles
to bring God into the lives of the people. But nothing works as he
anticipated. The world is in tumult with the death of JFK, civil rights
demonstrations, the war in Vietnam and the sexual revolution. Even the
rock-strong Catholic Church has been shaken by the second Vatican
Council.</p>
      <p>JP searches for answers. The fierce God of his childhood gives
way to a God of love. Helping others replaces a life of rules. But a
deep void eats at his heart. He is alone.</p>
      <p>When a young woman in the parish, Caitlin O'Neil, contacts him
for help, JP must decide what kind of priest he will be. Caitlin has
been ordered to fire the only black man in the company she works for.
Will JP offer pious advice or will he stand with her, even when he
discovers that the owner of the company is a good friend of the
bishop's?</p>
      <p>JP finds himself falling in love with Caitlin despite his
vows. Caitlin struggles with her feelings. She's been raised Catholic
and falling in love with a priest is taboo. In addition, a dynamic
union organizer has proposed to her. A wild ex-nun shows JP one way to
leave the priesthood, while a self-educated church janitor counsels a
different way.</p>
      <p>What is love? Where is God? Why celibacy? When do you follow
your conscience and not the church?&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
      <b><font size="4">About the author:</font></b></p>
      <p>Ed Griffin began his professional life in 1962 as a Roman
Catholic priest in Cleveland, Ohio. There he became active in the civil
rights movement and marched in Selma with Doctor Martin Luther King.
Removed from a suburban parish for his activities, he served for three
years in Cleveland's central city. His years in the Roman Catholic
Priesthood are the subject of Beyond the Vows.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>After leaving the priesthood in 1968 he earned a masters
degree at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee and was elected to
Milwaukee's city council in 1972. He met his wife, Kathy, in Milwaukee.
Raised an Irish Catholic, she was active in the civil rights and peace
movements.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Griffin and his wife opened a commercial greenhouse in
suburban Milwaukee in 1976. They lived where they worked and shared the
joys of raising children and growing flowers. In 1988 the family, Ed
and Kathy, Kevin and Kerry, moved to British Columbia, Canada, where
Griffin helped establish a dynamic writing community in the city of
Surrey. He is the founder of Western Canada's largest writer's
conference, the Surrey Writers' Conference. Ed teaches creative writing
at Matsqui Prison, a medium security prison in Western Canada. He
taught the same subject at Waupun prison, a maximum security prison in
Wisconsin.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>His first novel, <i>Prisoners of the Williwaw</i>, has been
optioned by HBO for a movie. The book is available through <a
 href="http://www.trafford.com/robots/00-0061.html">Trafford Publishing</a></p>
      <p>He has published poetry, plays, short stories and a newspaper
column. His writing has won several awards and the American Humanist
Society has honored him as the teacher of a prize-winning inmate
writer. Griffin believes that all the arts, including writing, should
be encouraged in prison. "As Aristotle said, 'art releases unconscious
tensions and purges the soul.'"</p>
