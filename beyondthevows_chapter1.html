Chapter 1</p>
      <p>All You Need Is Love<br>
The Beatles</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; JP, John Patrick, Lacey squeezed the rosary
wrapped tightly around his right hand. No.<br>
He would not let his mind wander to the woman who came to him in sleep.
It could lead to<br>
mortal sin.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He lay on his back in his steel institutional bed on
the first floor of St. Francis Seminary<br>
and prayed for help. Last night she wore a skimpy top and a plaid skirt
- Oh God, it was<br>
short. Despite her dress he knelt with her in front of the tabernacle
and then suddenly she<br>
threw her arms around him and kissed him, pressing her smooth, moist
lips tightly against<br>
his. Her tongue teased his mouth and found its way in and.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rosary or no rosary, his hand moved toward sin. He
jumped out of bed, got a drink of<br>
water at his sink and went over to the window. He cranked it open wide,
allowing cool<br>
October air and the light of a full moon to flood the room.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He looked at his hands in the moonlight, the hands
that had almost sinned. In a few short<br>
months the bishop would consecrate his hands because a priest touched
the sacred host. But<br>
JP already liked his hands because they worked so well. Every other
part of him seemed a<br>
little defective - thinning hair, a bridge in his mouth already, the
beginnings of a double chin<br>
and a right foot that never walked straight. But his hands - they were
electrician's hands,<br>
hands that knew how to use tools, hands like his father's and his
grandfather's.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He heard voices coming down Foster Avenue. When the
seminary was built, immigrant<br>
Catholics lived around it. But during the forties and fifties Southern
blacks moved to<br>
Newburg as they did to other big cities in the Mid-West. Now the
neighborhood was inner-<br>
city, poor and black.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, man, gimme a light," the first voice said.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This here's the priest factory. Ain't got no women."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Straight up?"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I ain't shittin ya."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ain't no good times in there, brother."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; JP turned away from the window. No, the good times
didn't matter. Soon he would be<br>
ordained and he would find great love in serving the people. He glanced
at the booklet, open<br>
on his desk, a scriptural analysis of the prophet, Isaiah. He knew the
section by heart:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I
have appointed you ..<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to
open the eyes of the blind,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to
free captives from prison<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and
those who live in darkness from the dungeon. (Chapter 42, verse 6)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He framed the text with his electrician hands. A
great life lay ahead for him. Like the<br>
messiah, he was being ordained to free the captives and give sight to
the blind.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Someone knocked quietly on his door. The luminous
hands on his clock said 11:15. He<br>
opened the door a little, careful to hang on to it, because the heated
air from the darkened<br>
corridor might suddenly stream in and slam open the door, bringing the
Prefect of Discipline<br>
down on him.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let's go for a smoke," Terry McGonagle, his
classmate, whispered. Terry was an<br>
ordained sub-deacon as of a month ago, just like JP. In May of the next
year, 1964, the two<br>
would lie on the floor of St. Edward's Cathedral in Newburg and be
ordained as Catholic<br>
priests.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I gotta talk," Terry said, his voice barely audible.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now? It's the Grand Silence."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; JP held to the Grand Silence strictly. It was a
period of absolute silence between lights<br>
out and breakfast in the morning. "During this time," the rule book
said, "the seminarian will<br>
be in touch with God."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I gotta talk. Come on."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; JP took a small, fearful step backward into his
room. He was in a quandary. He had never<br>
broken any major seminary rule, much less one as sacred as the Grand
Silence. But Terry<br>
needed to talk, probably about celibacy. He sounded as if he was in
crisis.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; JP looked down the hall. "Where's Reynolds?"
Monsignor Reynolds was the Prefect of<br>
Discipline.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He's in his room." Terry nodded down the hall.
"He's got a woman in there."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; JP caught the twinkle in Terry's eyes. If Reynolds
had a woman in there, she was<br>
probably scared to death. Reynolds' nickname was `Jowls', because of
his fleshy cheeks.<br>
`Jowls' could be an affectionate name, but Reynolds was anything but
likable. "The man is<br>
always scowling," Terry said on more than one occasion. "Reverend
Repressed Anger."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Reynolds were to suddenly open his door and see
them talking, he would lecture them<br>
with his cold anger and take away their next free day. JP couldn't
imagine what he would do<br>
if he found them sneaking out for a smoke.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Get your cassock. Let's go."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Tomorrow," JP whispered.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The woman in front of the tabernacle floated by in
his mind. She had shiny brown hair<br>
that flowed over her exposed shoulders and long, smooth legs leading up
to. Oh God.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again the turn-on. He inched his body behind the
door, so Terry wouldn't notice. He had<br>
to get this woman off his mind. Maybe he should go out for a smoke.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the Grand Silence.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come on," Terry said.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No, the rule was clear. No talking until breakfast.
But here was a man in the darkness of a<br>
dungeon. Wasn't he supposed to free him? Didn't Jesus say to love your
neighbor?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hang on, let me get my smokes."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Terry looked surprised, puzzled. "You'll go?"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yeah. What's the matter?"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nothing. You always say `no.' Come on."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; JP grabbed his red robe in the darkened room and put
it on over his pajamas.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not that," Terry whispered. "Jowls can see that
thing a mile away. It's black you want.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do I have to teach you everything?"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; JP smiled, took his robe off and put his cassock on.
He crept out into the warm corridor,<br>
noiselessly shutting his door. Only the exit light illuminated the
corridor as he followed Terry<br>
to the steps that led down to the courtyard. They slipped through the
door into the darkness<br>
outside and lit up, staying under the covered Spanish-style walkway and
out of the bright<br>
moonlight.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's with you, JP? For two years I've been asking
you to sneak out for a smoke and<br>
you always give me this pious, `It's against the rules.' Now all of a
sudden, you join me."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's the Vatican Council. The pope's going to throw
open the windows in the church."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So you can smoke?"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yeah, sure."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; JP breathed deeply of the October air and smelled a
hint of Lake Erie, not more than a<br>
mile to the north. He loved the lake, the sail boats, the romance of
knowing the water would<br>
reach Niagara. When he was a boy he put a message in a bottle and it
reached Toronto. Even<br>
though Newburg was a hundred miles from Cleveland, the ore carriers and
the cargo ships<br>
ran just a mile or two offshore and JP loved to watch them.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He glanced up at the full moon, framed by the lines
of the Spanish arch. His heart filled<br>
with the beauty of the evening. God was not far away. But he kept these
thoughts to himself.<br>
Terry would accuse him of getting pious again.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was strange that they were friends. Terry at
thirty-one was five years older than JP,<br>
more worldly, more cynical. Terry had gone to Newburg State University
before entering the<br>
seminary. All his life he had struggled with a weight problem, but to
JP it seemed right that<br>
Terry was chubby, for the older man was a generous person who took
everyone - and<br>
everything - in.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; JP had entered the seminary in his first year of
high school, eleven years previous. His<br>
appearance fitted his history, an innocent face, a sincere look about
him. When JP's sister<br>
told their mother that women in the parish would love JP, his mother
became upset. She<br>
didn't want other women loving her son. She wanted her son to remain a
priest.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; JP liked Terry because Terry made him think. Terry
was out on the fringes of orthodoxy,<br>
challenging what they were taught in class. "So, tell me, just why did
God stop talking to his<br>
people when the last book of the Bible was written?" and "Celibacy was
a way to make sure<br>
that the priest in the middle ages didn't pass on the church property
to his sons. What's the<br>
purpose of it today?"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Terry was a bulldog when it came to truth. He
wouldn't let go of a truth and JP liked this,<br>
even though he seldom agreed with him. Terry often brought in
principles of psychology and<br>
sociology he had learned at university.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was something more to their relationship that
JP couldn't define. Was it that JP's<br>
father had died at forty-seven and Terry's mother at thirty-six, giving
birth to Terry's<br>
younger brother? Was it that they were both on the fringes, Terry on
the left and JP on the<br>
right? Was it that Terry, alone among his classmates, listened to his
talk about ideals and<br>
Isaiah and the priesthood?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; JP didn't know the reason, but he knew this man was
his friend.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A light came on in one of the faculty rooms facing
onto the courtyard. JP and Terry slunk<br>
back into the shadows and palmed their cigarettes so no one could see
the glowing embers.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A siren wailed down the street outside the seminary.
Terry flicked his butt down and<br>
stepped on it. "I got a letter today."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "From?"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A woman I used to know."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And?"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "She wants to meet with me."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why? Come on, Terry, tell me the story. What's
going on?"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I knew her back in college. We lived together for a
year."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, why did she write you?"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Terry took off his glasses and squeezed the bridge
of his nose with force. "Damn. What<br>
am I going to do?"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why did she write you?" JP repeated.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "She broke up with the guy she's been going with for
the last couple years. She says I'm<br>
like Catholicism. I'm in her blood and she can't get me out. But she
said something else<br>
that's even more disturbing."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What?"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Here. Read it."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Terry pulled a multi-page letter from his pocket. JP
saw that it had been read many times.<br>
Terry handed him one page and pointed to a section of the neat
handwriting near the bottom<br>
of the page.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; JP stepped out into the bright moonlight.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ". and that's why I can't understand what you're
doing. You know what we said. AND<br>
YOU AGREED WITH IT. You can't live without love, Terry."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; JP handed the letter back to Terry, carefully, as if
it were a bomb. He looked up at the<br>
moon. Deep down he knew the letter writer was correct about Terry, that
he needed love to<br>
live, but how did that square with Catholic doctrine? What about his
calling to the<br>
priesthood?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's her name?"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nancy."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; JP took a drag on his cigarette. "I don't know, man.
If you want to be a priest, I think you<br>
should avoid this Nancy person."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Put-ty." That was Terry's response to seminary
directives. He always split the two<br>
syllables and emphasized them. Like seminarians were to be put-ty in
the hands of the<br>
faculty. "Nancy's a human being. She's not to be avoided. The thing is,
I want to be a priest.<br>
When I was growing up, Father Joe, my parish priest, raised money for
the local hospital and<br>
said the prayer at the Chamber of Commerce breakfast and."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You told me about him."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The point is, he was a respected member of the
community."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So?"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's what I want - to be a priest like him."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The tough answer was right on JP's tongue. Give her
up. But he didn't say it.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The moon illuminated the statue in the center of the
courtyard. St. Francis stood with his<br>
arms out and his palms up, receiving God's creatures and God's message.
If Terry put his<br>
hands out and received the calling from God, he would have to live
without love and his soul<br>
would shrivel and die.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; JP scratched his regulation short haircut. What was
wrong? How could there be such a<br>
contradiction in the faith his mother and his father had given him? For
a second he felt dizzy,<br>
as if the courtyard were a slanted floor in a fun house. Was it the
smoking late at night or was<br>
it that, for a second, he doubted his faith?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This was disturbing. This was not some theoretical
argument about an ancient heresy. This was Terry's life - and his.
Maybe if he repeated Pops Gibson's sermon on celibacy.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The thing is, Terry, the word full. You know how
Pops said we're gonna be full of love, like<br>
Mary was full of grace? We're gonna reach the fullness of love by
giving ourselves to<br>
celibacy. Love - that's the thing."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Pious dribble," Terry said.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; JP shook his head and gazed into the courtyard. The
trouble with Terry was he always<br>
talked about empty. Something was being taken away from him, like the
right to marry. You<br>
had to think full. And you had to give full in order to get full.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But he had never received a letter like that. What
if a woman wrote to him? Who was<br>
there for him? Nobody but the woman in his dreams. Last night she
reached down inside his<br>
pants and . was there no end to these sexual thoughts? He dropped his
cigarette and<br>
exclaimed, "Jesus. Mary and Joseph."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's the matter?"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He stepped on the glowing ember. "Burned myself."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again the silence of the night came over them. JP
felt the pain in Terry's heart, but the<br>
answer to celibacy was to commit your whole heart to God. That's where
love lay. It was<br>
simple.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Terry broke the silence. "My dad called me about the
Olds he ordered for me. Delivery<br>
May 1. Automatic, air conditioned, the whole bit."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Great."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You still getting a Chevy?"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yeah."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Stick shift?"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah, yes, the proletariat image. I keep telling you,
man, you're going to be a parish priest.<br>
A parish priest shouldn't be chugging along in a Chevy like an
encyclopedia salesman who<br>
flunked out of college."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; JP said nothing. His mother had said something
similar. He let his eyes wander over the<br>
courtyard, focusing on a dwarf tree at the other end. The moon painted
a shadow of the tree<br>
on the arches behind it. The shadow danced as the breeze stirred the
few remaining leaves on<br>
the tree. The magnificence of the scene brought the beginning of tears
to his eyes. "Terry,<br>
Terry," he said, pointing out to the courtyard "Yes, we're doing the
right thing. Look at the<br>
beauty of the world."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yeah, sure. I can't figure you, Lacey. You get a
Chevy. That I understand. Blessed are<br>
the poor. You get good grades, the faculty trusts you, you're probably
gonna be a monsignor,<br>
maybe even a bishop. What I can't figure is how you put love into all
this."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You give love and you'll get love. You love the
people, you love the church, you'll get<br>
love."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Pie in the sky."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come on, Terry."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I mean it, JP. You've got it all romanticized.
The church isn't perfect, the life of a<br>
priest isn't perfect, but it's a damn site better than anything else
out there. You live the life -<br>
you take what comes. You put up with some bullshit, but you get the
respect of the people -<br>
and a decent income to boot. Oh, and of course, when you die you walk
right into the pearly<br>
gates."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Terry pulled out another smoke, but then returned it
to the pack. "Come on, JP, I'm<br>
hungry. Let's go for a snack."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Snack? This isn't a drive-in."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I know where the faculty cookie jar is."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You're kidding me," JP said. "The faculty has a
cookie jar?"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yeah. There's a cupboard just inside the faculty
dining room. They don't lock the door<br>
at night. The nuns keep the jar filled."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How do you know all this?"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He rubbed his plump stomach. "Experience, my boy,
experience."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How dangerous is it?"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Jowls almost caught me once. He was on his way
there. Bastard preaches to us about the<br>
Grand Silence and then he raids the cookie jar."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; JP smiled. "You go ahead. I'd better get back to my
room."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I want to talk more."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "About?"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nancy."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't think you should. I think you should trash
that letter. At least get your mind off<br>
it."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nothing will get my mind off it like high adventure
to the cookie jar."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not for me."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then stay for one more smoke."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They lit up and talked - about everything but Nancy.
JP told of his mother's plan for a<br>
big ordination reception. "She's getting the house painted, buying new
furniture, hiring a<br>
hall. It's big."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "For an Irish Catholic, it is big," Terry said. "The
mother of a priest."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Too bad my dad isn't alive," JP said<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How close did he get to ordination?".<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He left after first year of theology," JP answered.
"Then he married my mother."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "History repeating itself. Him in the seminary and
now you. I can see why your<br>
ordination is so important to your mom."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you mean?"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Terry glanced at him. "You know how people talked in
the old days. Come on, let's raid<br>
the cookie jar."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What a strange night. For the past eleven years he
had kept the Grand Silence. Tonight<br>
the only thing that mattered was his friend, Terry. And now a little
more rule-breaking.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Lead on, Falstaff." Falstaff was Terry's favorite
Shakespearean character, rotund as he<br>
was, full of life and hell-raising.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The two padded down the corridors, staying close to
the walls, going right past Jowls'<br>
door. In the faculty dining room Terry opened a cupboard and pulled
down a large ceramic<br>
jar shaped like Santa Claus.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only a night-light lit the room but JP saw homemade
cookies in the jar with big chocolate<br>
bits in them. Fresh cookie smell filled the space. "Oh, man, Terry,
this is great."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; JP took two cookies and started to eat them. Terry
selected a cookie, but didn't eat it. He<br>
tapped the cookie on the edge of the jar and looked at JP. "I wish you
hadn't come with me<br>
tonight."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What? I thought you wanted to talk."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You don't get it, do you, JP? I wanted you to say
no."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No?"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "See, it's a ritual I have. I ask you to break the
rules with me and you say no and then I<br>
know this training works. Maybe it doesn't work for me, but it works
for you. When we get<br>
out and we're priests, we'll be able to resist the temptations of the
world because we've had<br>
seminary training. But, see, you've had eleven years of it and. it
doesn't work."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; JP stopped eating cookies.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Terry dropped his cookie back into the jar and held
up his hands. Tears came into his<br>
eyes. "What's gonna keep these hands out of the cookie jar when we get
ordained?"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A door banged shut nearby. The two froze. "Let's get
out of here," Terry whispered.<br>
They crept past Jowls' door and came to JP's room. JP patted Terry on
the back. "Hang<br>
in there, man," he whispered.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Terry nodded. JP watched him sneak down the hall and
turn the corner, his shoulders<br>
slumped, his head down.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; JP slinked into his room. Isaiah still sat on the
desk, calling him to free captives and give<br>
sight to the blind. JP hung up his cassock and lay on the bed. Outside
his window the ice-blue<br>
moonlight shone on the maple tree near the entrance. Half the leaves
were gone; the other<br>
half fluttered in the breeze.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The world was wonderful. He closed his eyes. She was
beside him again, the ghost<br>
woman. She lay beside him quietly in her skimpy top and her short,
short skirt. She held his<br>
electrician's hand and gazed at the tree with him.</p>
