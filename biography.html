      <p align="left"><b><font size="5">About the author...</font></b></p>
      <p align="left">Ed Griffin teaches creative writing at Matsqui
Prison, a medium security prison in Western Canada.<span>&nbsp; </span>He
taught the same subject at Waupun prison, a maximum security prison in
Wisconsin.</p>
      <p align="left">He began his professional life in 1962 as a Roman
Catholic priest in Cleveland, Ohio.<span>&nbsp; </span>There he became
active in the civil<span>&nbsp; </span>rights movement and marched in
Selma with Doctor Martin Luther King.<span>&nbsp; </span>Removed from
a suburban parish for his activities, he served for three years in
Cleveland&rsquo;s central city.<span>&nbsp; </span>His years in the
Roman Catholic Priesthood are the subject of his next novel.</p>
      <p align="left">After leaving the priesthood in 1968 he earned a
masters degree at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee and was elected
to Milwaukee's city council in 1972.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p align="left">Griffin and his wife, Kathy, opened a commercial
greenhouse in suburban Milwaukee in 1976.<span>&nbsp; </span>They
lived where they worked and shared the joys of raising children and
growing flowers.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In 1988 the family, Ed and
Kathy, Kevin and Kerry, moved to British Columbia, Canada, where
Griffin helped establish a dynamic writing community in the city of
Surrey.<span>&nbsp; </span>He is the founder of Western Canada's
largest writer&rsquo;s conference, the <a href="http://www.siwc.ca/">Surrey
Writers&rsquo; Conference</a>.</p>
      <p align="left">He has published poetry, plays, short stories and
a newspaper column.<span>&nbsp; </span>His writing has won several
awards and the American Humanist Society has honored him as the teacher
of a prize-winning inmate writer. Griffin believes that all the arts,
including writing, should be encouraged in prison.<span>&nbsp; </span>"As
Aristotle said, 'art releases unconscious tensions and purges the
soul.'"</p>
