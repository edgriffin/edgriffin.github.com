      <br>
      <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;">A man in a Fraser
Valley prison struggles to complete his degree. It&rsquo;s part of his
correctional
plan that he finish, but there&rsquo;s no money in the system to pay
for courses. A
female inmate wants to become a drug and alcohol counselor to help
others avoid
the pitfalls that led her to jail. She just needs a few college
courses, but
the little money she earns in prison ($6.90 a day) goes for phone calls
to stay
close to her family. She can&rsquo;t afford tuition.</p>
      <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;">&nbsp;</p>
      <p style="margin: 12pt 0in 0.0001pt;">Through the John Howard
Society, a
humanitarian organization (<a href="http://www.johnhowardbc.ca/">http://www.johnhowardbc.ca/</a>),
Ed Griffin has set up a bursary to help BC inmates with the expenses of
higher education. Those who seek education are trying to better
themselves.
They know that education is the proven way out of crime. You will
receive a tax
receipt from the John Howard Society, who will in turn present money to
the
educational institution that the winning inmate has chosen. To donate,
