I will be there every Monday, starting January 3, 2011, from 10 AM to

            <p class="MsoNormal" style="">This
centre is near the intersection of King George and 72nd Ave.
It&rsquo;s
in a converted fire hall,
across from McDonalds. There&rsquo;s ample parking, but
it&rsquo;s best
to approach the
centre from the west, since 72nd has a barrier in the middle of the
street
there. For example, enter 72nd from 132nd Street and drive toward King
George. It&rsquo;ll be on
your right, just before King George. </p>
            <p class="MsoNormal" style="">All
are welcome. Bring your stories, articles, novels, poems, whatever and
I will
try to help you toward publication. No appointment necessary. Come for
the
writing, but enjoy the art.</p>
