      <p>He didn't just walk into the classroom, Mike Oulton made an
entrance that fully satisfied what he calls his COA, the "centre of
attention" syndrome that has made him a people-magnet, from the druggy
streets of Victoria to a filthy Mexican jail and, at that moment eight
years ago, a small room with desks and cinder-block walls at the
max-security lockup in Matsqui.</p>
      <p>The instructor of the creative-writing class, Ed Griffin,
didn't know what to make of the loud pounding at the door and the
stocky, dark-haired guy who then slid into the centre of the room and
waved his arms with flare, like a rock star on stage.</p>
      <p>"We were in the middle of class," recalls Griffin, "and I was
teaching the students about exclamation points and how they're not
needed, and here was this walking, talking exclamation point who'd
entered the room."</p>
      <p>They didn't know it at the time but Oulton's memorable intro
was the start of an unlikely friendship between a cocky, charismatic
would-be boxer, who'd been caught running drugs a couple years
previous, and a socially conservative former priest who taught convicts
the finer points of writing. Today, the 30-ish Oulton and Griffin,
who's well into what others call their retirement years, have
collaborated to write an engaging and entertaining book that nicely
dovetails their experiences in jail and with the Canadian prison system
that frustrates and angers them.</p>
      <p>A good slice of Dystopia spins Oulton's hard-life tale, from
foster homes to juvie-detention centres, hustling bottles of Ritalin at
school to unloading half-gram "spitballs" of cocaine -- not-so-sweet
work for a 16-year-old. His street-corner drug-dealing escalated to a
botched plan of running 15 keys of coke, "hidden" in a car's
passenger-side airbag compartment, northbound to the Tijuana-San Diego
border and on to Canada.</p>
      <p>"I've made a lot of bad decisions in my life," Oulton says,
"and that was one of them. The theme of my life, from the beginning to
right now, could be summed up as bad choices, bad decisions and putting
myself at risk for no reason."</p>
      <p>Two years spent in a Mexican prison was, not surprisingly, not
much fun for Oulton, who kept his sanity by writing in a journal. He
boxed a little, too, going two-for-three with a couple KOs, triumphant
front-page photos in the local paper and, on the unethical side, a
thrown fight that made him good money but couldn't buy his way out of
solitary confinement in a dark, overheated pit, or a lengthy,
stomach-churning bout of gastritis. Transferred to a Canadian prison,
Oulton eventually found his way to Griffin's creative-writing class and
discovered a gift that had apparently been inside him all along.</p>
      <p>The American-born Griffin, who has 40 years on his co-author
and friend, travelled a jail-free path to Canada. In the 1960s,
inspired by Martin Luther King's civil-rights movement, the Catholic
young man answered the call to march at Selma, Alabama -- an act that
shocked his parishioners back in white, suburban Cleveland and put him
at odds with the church he'd leave just five years into his priesthood.
In the Reagan years, he and his wife, Cathy, uprooted their family from
Milwaukee, where he was elected to city council, and moved across the
border and west to Cloverdale to continue in the greenhouse business.
But what grew was Griffin's passion for writing, to the point of
teaching in prisons, founding the Surrey Writer's Conference and
authoring several books of fiction.</p>
      <p>No pay for teaching prisoners</p>
      <p>Griffin now volunteers his time to teach writing at Matsqui
after being told last September that the authorities could no longer
pay for his services. "I have a master's degree," Griffin says
ruefully, "but no teaching certificate, so I'm out. It's OK, it's fine.
I'm still going."</p>
      <p>This week, he's one session into teaching his latest
Introduction to Creative Writing class at Semiahmoo Secondary in South
Surrey. But it's this month's launch of Dystopia that is most pressing
for Griffin, who is losing an unfair fight with prostate cancer. All
things considered, it might be his final, and most memorable, book. "I
went into prison trying to start a revolution, that writing could
change lives, and I found a friend," he says.</p>
      <p>Their collaboration began as a book called Inside Out, which
had Oulton (the insider) riffing on the value of the Canadian prison
system and Griffin (the outsider) railing against it -- what he calls
the "rip-off" of putting convicts in a "warehouse" with few resources
for true rehabilitation. Over time, the younger author began to
understand and embrace Griffin's views, thanks to an incident involving
a fellow prisoner's cellphone being found in a sock. Oulton was denied
parole because he wouldn't rat out the guy, and spent 15 additional
months in jail because of it. "That's when we changed the whole book
around," Oulton says, "including the title."</p>
      <p>At Matsqui and, later, Ferndale, Oulton was told to forget his
dream of becoming a writer.</p>
      <p>"The psychologist said writing was unrealistic and that I
should focus more on construction or a labour job of some kind," Oulton
recalls. "If you have a dream or some kind of talent -- and I really
believe I can be some kind of writer -- they don't support that in
prisons.... I even had one PO (parole officer) suggest I go on welfare.
That was just ridiculous, but (ex-prisoners) will actually do that
because the PO said so and they'll get free money and leach off the
system. It's retarded."</p>
      <p>In prison, he says, convicts might be schooled in, say,
welding and actually later get a job doing that on the outside, but
they aren't given life skills such as how to open a bank account or use
the internet. "The prison system doesn't set people up to succeed, it
sets them up to fail," Oulton says as Griffin nods his agreement while
seated at the kitchen table of his North Surrey home.</p>
      <p>Eight years of jail behind him and recently free from the
burden of a halfway house, Oulton now lives in Coquitlam and works as a
pub DJ five nights a week. During the day, he gets his writing fix with
an eye on getting into the entertainment biz. He's already written
dozens of scripts for TV and big-screen movies, including one based on
Dystopia.</p>
      <p>The book, put out by the on-demand Trafford publishing house
in Victoria, is not without some typos and grammatical gaffs -- and
Oulton is smart enough to know it. "It would have been better to have
an editor," he says with a groan.</p>
      <p>The well-mannered ex-con's dream of becoming a boxer is all
but dead, thanks to an aging body that no longer responds well to
prolonged workouts.</p>
      <p>"I've hung up my gloves -- undefeated, I might add," he says,
ignoring the fight he threw for $500 back in Mexico, which bought him
food and other jail-life comforts.</p>
      <p>Bravely, in pursuit of a fresh start and clean life, he says
he's cut all ties to his drug-dealing, no-good cronies on Vancouver
Island.</p>
      <p>Long ago, one of his pals in prison was Ricardo Scarpino, the
known gangster who was gunned down in a vehicle outside a Vancouver
steakhouse in January on the night of his engagement party. In fact,
while jailed at Matsqui, Scarpino was the one who introduced Oulton to
Griffin's creative-writing class.</p>
      <p>"Both of them were dynamos, very creative, good writers,"
Griffin recalls. "Scarpino went one way, though, and Mike has gone
another."</p>
      <p>Griffin went to Scarpino's funeral, but Oulton did not.</p>
      <p>"Surrounding yourself with good people is key," Oulton told
the Now last week. "Since I've gotten out (of jail), I've really
avoided the people who've dragged me down my whole life, who led me to
make bad decisions. Now I just associate myself with good people, like
Ed.</p>
      <p>"We complement each other," he continues, "but we're totally
different, personality-wise. He doesn't like to act out in public and
then there's me -- he allows me to act out in public for him. I'm the
entertainer, the talker, the showman, and Ed is the observer who sits
back and takes it all in. He laughs at my jokes and I like making him
laugh, because he really needs it. We're good friends and that's out of
necessity in some ways. We both need each other."</p>
      <p>- Mike Oulton and Ed Griffin will launch and sign copies of
Dystopia at a Rainwriters event Saturday, February 16 from 1 to 3 p.m.
at the Chapters store at Strawberry Hill, at 72nd Avenue near Scott
Road in Surrey. For more details, see www.rainwriters.com or
www.edgriffin.net. Dystopia is also available online at amazon.ca for
$19.49.</p>

            <p>Some people view Canada&rsquo;s prison system as a
training camp for criminals, a place where rehabilitation can seem
futile, if not a laughably unattainable objective.</p>
            <p>'Repeat offender' is a widely used term these days and
odds are most prisoners currently in custody will return to jail at
some point after being released on parole.</p>
            <p>But once in a while, the system shows signs of promise.
A convicted felon decides at some point to change his life, and walks
out a different person.</p>
            <p>Mike Oulton might be one of those guys.</p>
            <p>Oulton, born and raised in Victoria, was convicted of
trying to smuggle 15 kilograms of cocaine from Mexico into the United
States and sentenced to 10 years in prison. He was fortunate enough to
be transferred from a Mexican jail to Canada to serve his sentence and
has since been released and embarked upon the next stage of his life as
a writer.</p>
            <p>Inside the walls of Matsqui medium-security prison just
outside of Abbotsford, it was another man who initiated Oulton&rsquo;s
climb to respectability.</p>
            <p>Ed Griffin, a former Roman Catholic priest, was teaching
a writing class in 2000 at Matsqui when Oulton literally walked into
his life. It was the birth of a friendship that endures today.</p>
            <p>"I was doing a creative writing class and I was talking
about exclamation points and how they&rsquo;re overused, and how you
don't need them in writing all that much," Griffin, a transplanted
American, recalled from his home in Surrey. "And then there was this
banging on the door and in walked Mike and he kind of took the class
over. And I watched him and I thought, you know, here's this walking,
talking exclamation point."</p>
            <p>Oulton, who now lives and works in Port Moody, said he
noticed something in Griffin instantly. In and out of foster homes and
schools throughout his youth, Oulton was known for his showmanship as
much as his ability to piss off anyone he felt had authority over him.
He tried to get Griffin's goat, too, but had no luck.</p>
            <p>"Ed didn&rsquo;t get rattled," Oulton said. "Usually
when I&rsquo;d done something like that in the past to a teacher it got
them going. And I would get some kind of sick enjoyment out of it, but
Ed just kept on going and I instantly had respect for him."</p>
            <p>With Griffin's help and support, Oulton&rsquo;s natural
talent for creative writing blossomed over time. While incarcerated he
wrote more than 20 screenplays and even penned a Harlequin romance
novel.</p>
            <p>Most recently, the two collaborated on Dystopia, a
nonfiction book that recounts both their experiences with the prison
system. Before arriving at Matsqui, Griffin taught creative writing at
Waupun prison, a maximum security institution in Wisconsin, and
published fiction novels.</p>
            <p>"We originally started with the title as Inside Out,"
said Griffin. "Mike was going to write from the inside and show people
that prison offered some good points. I was going to write from the
outside, saying it was all a waste and that it was just kind of a
breeding ground or training ground for criminals."</p>
            <p>The book morphed into Dystopia, which recounts
Oulton&rsquo;s tough upbringing, his life as a drug dealer and
Griffin's experiences as a priest dating to the 1960s, when he marched
with Dr. Martin Luther King in Selma, Alabama.</p>
            <p>Part of Oulton's side of the story repeats the mantra
"There&rsquo;s no such thing as a halfway crook" &ndash; a line from
"The Infamous" by gangsta rappers Mobb Deep. The line was huge for
Oulton growing up, he said, but it still applies.</p>
            <p>"You&rsquo;re either in or you&rsquo;re out," he
explained.</p>
            <p>"There&rsquo;s no halfway about it. Even if you've just
got one foot in it, you're still a part of it. And it can come and take
over your whole life. So it's kind of a metaphor for being in the game.
And also for me, getting out of it, you know there's no such thing as a
halfway straight person."</p>
            <p>Not only does Oulton consider himself reformed, his
writing career is on the verge of exploding.</p>
            <p>He's just finished writing a script for a diamond heist
movie called A Three Affair for We Made This Entertainment, a film and
television company based out of Vancouver, and is in talks to produce a
television script for both Comedy Central and FOX.</p>
            <p>While the prison system may be inherently flawed in its
ability to rehabilitate people, Oulton said, there are times when
people like Griffin come along and make a difference.</p>
            <p>"When I got out the last time I told myself I wasn't
going back to that (life)," he said.</p>
            <p>"The thing people need to know is that people can
change. And in jail, none of the guys have any confidence and
there&rsquo;s nothing in there giving them that confidence, telling
them there's something they can do with their life other than be a
criminal. And that's what Ed did for me. He allowed me to gain that
confidence."</p>
