      </span>Name Ed Griffin<br>
      <br>
Age 75<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fiona</span>: Where are you from?<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ed</span>: Born in Cleveland,
Ohio and served as a Catholic Priest there for
five years. Moved to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where I met my wife and our
children were born. Lived there for eighteen years. Moved to Surrey,
British Columbia, Canada in 1988<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fiona</span>: A little about
your self `ie your education Family life ect<span
 class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ed</span>: Raised in a good
Catholic family, I entered the seminary in first
year high school. Twelve years later I was ordained. So I had four
years of high school, four years of college, and four years of
theology. During my priesthood, I took a one-year course in urban
ministry from Western Reserve University. After I left the priesthood,
I obtained a masters degree from the University of Wisconsin in
community organization. So after university, I had seven more years of
schooling. You&rsquo;d think I knew something after all that.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fiona</span>: Tell us your
latest news?<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ed:</span> I&rsquo;ve just
signed up for KDP Select and I&rsquo;m
excited about that.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fiona</span>: When and why did
you begin writing?<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ed</span>: In 1983, at the age
of forty-seven, I discovered creative writing.
It changed my life. I would sit down at the typewriter after supper and
follow my creative muse. Whole worlds opened to me. I wrote about the
space behind my childhood garage where I practiced pitching and dreamed
of reaching the major leagues. I wrote a short story about a group of
prisoners on an island. I wrote a poem about getting along with the
Russians. Hours passed. Suddenly, as I wrote, an alarm would ring in
the house. My wife and I owned a commercial greenhouse outside
Milwaukee, Wisconsin, a ma-and-pa operation. The alarm meant I
hadn&rsquo;t turned the heat on. I had to shut the door on the
vibrant world that grew on the paper in front of me and hurry to the
greenhouses to start the furnaces. An hour later I&rsquo;d be back at
the typewriter. Type a sentence,
stop, look at it, realize it wasn&rsquo;t quite true and then
search deeper, ever deeper. Layers of middle-aged half-truths
disappeared, the comfortable maxims I had surrounded myself with
&ndash; &ldquo;Business is good. Don&rsquo;t make any
changes&rdquo; and &ldquo;Relax. You&rsquo;re getting
older.&rdquo; The fires of my youth burned again &ndash; civil
rights, world peace, a place in the sun for every person. I was a
Catholic priest as a young man, filled with idealism. I marched in
Selma with Doctor King, picketed local companies to give jobs to
blacks, and confronted my own bishop over the church&rsquo;s
institutional racism.<br>
As I wrote, I dug, I searched, always deeper, ever more honest. It
might be easy to speak a lie, but it wasn&rsquo;t easy to write
one. I started to unravel the tangled skein that was me. What a
wonderful gift this was.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fiona</span>: When did you first
consider yourself a writer?<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ed</span>: In 1985, the State of
Wisconsin called for volunteers to teach
creative writing in the prison system. I signed up and was assigned to
the maximum-security prison at Waupun, Wisconsin. I&rsquo;d never
taught before, but as I looked at those twelve mean-looking dudes, I
said, &ldquo;My name is Ed Griffin. I&rsquo;m a
writer.&rdquo;<br>
In the next hour I learned how to teach. I knew there would be trouble,
if I didn&rsquo;t keep these guys interested and if I
didn&rsquo;t give them some good instruction. I&rsquo;ve taught
in prison ever since.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fiona</span>: What inspired you
to write your first book?<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ed</span>: From working with
prisoners, I knew they were not a bunch of
snarling, murdering convicts, as TV often portrays them. And I also
knew that the prison system wasn&rsquo;t helping them at all and
was costing the taxpayer millions of dollars. Many staff were busy
playing solitaire on their computers, as I noticed in the prison.
Surely, there had to be a better way. I began thinking about putting
these prisoners on an island with their families, with only the Coast
Guard to keep them on the island. What would happen? Would they kill
each other or would they set up a workable, if rough, society? And so I
wrote my first book, a novel, Prisoners of the Williwaw. A williwaw is
a fierce wind that happens in the Aleutian Islands.<br>
Since then I have written four other books, two more novels and two
books of non-fiction.<br>
Beyond the Vows, a novel. What inspired me to write this book were the
traumatic events of my young life, where I marched in Selma with Dr.
Martin Luther King and was kicked out of a parish. The church that I
had given my life to, did not stand up against racism. I turned this
story into fiction.<br>
Veto, a novel. I have long had an interest in the United Nations. I
wrote a novel about a woman who becomes Secretary General of the UN,
and turns this tired organization into an effective government to help
people.<br>
Dystopia, non-fiction. An inmate and I told our stories of prison. Mike
Oulton was arrested in Mexico for smuggling drugs and spent two years
in a Mexican prison and eight years in Canadian prisons. It&rsquo;s
interesting to see which one he liked better. And I wrote my story of
teaching in prison. I wanted to teach men to write so they could tell
the world of the dystopia they lived in.<br>
Once A Priest is a themed autobiography, the theme being that I may
have left the priesthood in 1968, but it hasn&rsquo;t left me. When
some people leave the church, they wipe it out of their lives. While I
don&rsquo;t talk about God or religion, I still carry with me the
things I learned in the church &ndash; help the poor, work for
peace and so forth.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fiona</span>: Do you have a
specific writing style?<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ed</span>: Yes. Early on I
determined that I wanted to write for ordinary
people. The way I like to say it, is that I write for the supermarket,
where popular, easy to read, page-turners are displayed right by the
checkout counters. There&rsquo;s lots of dialogue in my writing and
lots of action. I&rsquo;m often weak on description. I am not a
literary writer.<br>
Even though I know that eighty-five percent of what is written is
non-fiction, the gods have made me a fiction writer and I just have to
accept that.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fiona</span>: How did you come
up with the title?<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ed</span>: Prisoners of the
Williwaw. While the men were no longer in prison,
they were prisoners of the environment of the Aleutian Islands and they
were often prisoners of their own hearts.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fiona</span>: Is there a message
in your novel that you want readers to grasp?<span
 class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ed</span>: Yes. Convicts are not
like what you see on TV. For four years I
worked in a remand center, a pre-trial facility. A woman inmate read
the book and said to me, &ldquo;I know what you were trying to
do.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Is that right? What did you think?&rsquo;<br>
&ldquo;You were trying to say that convicts can do something
worthwhile. And I really liked it that all your convicts were guilty.
TV stories are often about an innocent man who gets caught in prison
for one reason or another. All of your characters were guilty and yet
they did something great.&rdquo;<br>
Better than ever before, this woman had it down perfect.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fiona</span>: How much of the
book is realistic?<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ed</span>: There is a similar
prison run by the Mexican Government called the
Islas Marias off the coast of the Pacific. And my story is reminiscent
of the history of Australia.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fiona</span>: Are experiences
based on someone you know, or events in your own
life?<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ed</span>: No, they are based on
the men and women I have known in
twenty-three years of teaching in prison.<span
 class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fiona</span>: What books have
most influenced your life most?<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ed</span>: One Flew Over the
Cuckoos Nest by Ken Kesey<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Writing Well, William Zinsser.<span
 class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; David Cooperfield by Charles Dickens<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Writer&rsquo;s Journey by
Christopher Vogler<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Elements of Style by Strunk and White<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pacem in Terris by Pope John XXIII<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fiona</span>: If you had to
choose, which writer would you consider a mentor?
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ed</span>: Hemmingway<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fiona</span>: What book are you
reading now?<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ed</span>: The Shelfless Book by
Bob Mayer, Short Stories by Alice Munro<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fiona</span>: Are there any new
authors that have grasped your interest?<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ed</span>: Christopher Vogler
has taught me the hero&rsquo;s journey and
has introduced me to the work of Joseph Campbell and his study of
mythology.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fiona</span>: What are your
current projects?<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ed</span>: I&rsquo;m working on
two projects right now. One is a sequel to
Prisoners of the Williwaw. The other is called Delaney&rsquo;s
Hope. People often say to me, &ldquo;Griffin, you&rsquo;re
against prison. So what&rsquo;s your answer?&rdquo;
I&rsquo;m trying to write my answer, a novel in which Tom Delaney
sets up an experimental prison with three staff and five inmates in a
camp in northern Wisconsin.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fiona</span>: Name one entity
that you feel supported you outside of family
members.<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ed</span>: For over ten years,
I&rsquo;ve been a member of a dynamic
writing group, called the Rainwriters. (It usually rains when we meet).
We are only seven writers who meet every two weeks. We start on time
and end on time &ndash; two hours. We never read at the meeting,
rather we hand out work at the meeting to be reviewed at the next
meeting.<br>
This group has helped me with many writing problems and publishing
problems. I know some people don&rsquo;t work well in groups and I
know some writing groups are just social gatherings but I
couldn&rsquo;t live without the Rainwriters.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fiona</span>: Do you see writing
as a career?<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ed</span>: It&rsquo;s been my
career for the last twenty years, that and
teaching writing. If I had to do my life over, I would have started
writing much earlier. I&rsquo;m glad that I have writing for my
so-called retirement years.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fiona</span>: If you had to do
it all over again, would you change anything in
your latest book?<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ed</span>: I don&rsquo;t think
so. I keep looking forward, not back.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fiona</span>: Do you recall how
your interest in writing originated?<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ed</span>: It&rsquo;s always
been at the back of my mind. Once &ndash;
only once &ndash; in high school I wrote an essay that the teacher
said was very good. But in my forties, as I relayed earlier, I was
making good money in our greenhouse, but I knew my mind was atrophying.
So I began to write.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fiona</span>: Is there anything
you find particularly challenging in your
writing?<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ed</span>: Description. If it
was up to me, my novels would be dialogue and
action. But I know I&rsquo;m wrong and the women in the Rainwriters
don&rsquo;t hesitate to tell me I&rsquo;m wrong. I have to help
my readers feel that they are really on the scene. There&rsquo;s a
great quote &ndash; something like, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t show
me what the rain was like, make me feel wet.&rdquo; I have to go
back over my work and see if I&rsquo;ve made the people and places
come alive. Description, using all the senses, that&rsquo;s a
challenge for me.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fiona</span>: Who is your
favorite author and what is it that really strikes
you about their work?<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ed</span>: Dickens &ndash; I
wish I could do characters like he does.
Amazing. I can see David Cooperfield, Uriah Heep, Scrooge, etc. etc.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fiona</span>: Do you have to
travel much concerning your book(s)?<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ed</span>: No, I don&rsquo;t.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fiona</span>: Who designed the
covers?<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ed</span>: The art comes from a
local artist, but all the work was done by my
daughter and her husband.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fiona</span>: What was the
hardest part of writing your book?<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ed</span>: The constant review.
I write a novel the first time and review it
with the Rainwriters. Then a second draft and review by the
Rainwriters. Then a thorough review by my daughter, an English major,
who corrects my grammar and tells me directly what things
don&rsquo;t work. Rewrite number three. Then I ask some special
readers to look at the whole book and give me some feedback. This
process takes a good three to four years.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fiona</span>: Did you learn
anything from writing your book and what was it?<span
 class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ed</span>: I learned a lot from
writing my last book, Once A Priest. When I
looked at my own life, I discovered that I wasn&rsquo;t the hero I
always thought I was. I began to see things from other
people&rsquo;s perspectives.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fiona</span>: Do you have any
advice for other writers?<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ed</span>: Writers write. They
write when the feel inspired and when they
don&rsquo;t. Writers write.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fiona</span>: Do you have
anything specific that you want to say to your
readers?<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ed</span>: Don&rsquo;t ever let
me get away with making a speech.
Don&rsquo;t let me preach. Stop me. Write to me. Kick me.<span
 class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fiona</span>: If you were not a
writer what else would you like to have done?<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ed</span>: Become a family doctor<br>
Visit outer space<br>
Become a crusading lawyer to help indigent people in prison<br>
Become a great astronomer and teach astronomy in a university<br>
Be a construction supervisor<br>
Drive a big eighteen-wheeler truck<br>
Become the Pope and radically change the Catholic religion<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fiona</span>: Do you have a
blog/website? if so what is it?<br>

Shut it down. Shut it down. Tom Delaney could barely hear the reporter
over the marchers&rsquo; protests.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br>
&ldquo;Why a new kind of prison?&rdquo; she yelled.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong with what we have?&rdquo;<span
 class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br>
Suppressing his anger at the protest, he spoke into the black foam ball
covering the microphone. &ldquo;For one thing, prisons are costing
the taxpayer a lot of money. It costs a hundred dollars a day to keep a
man in prison.&rdquo;<br>
The newswoman glanced at her notes, while the cameraman panned the
protestors blocking the gate to this rural experimental prison camp.
Someone grabbed Delaney&rsquo;s shoulder and pulled him backwards.
He lost his balance and started to fall, but another shove pushed him
forward. He ended up face down on the asphalt. A knee jammed into his
back, pinning him down.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br>
&ldquo;Fuckin&rsquo; do-gooder,&rdquo; the person on his
back shouted.<br>
Someone kicked him hard on the leg.<br>
Delaney&rsquo;d seen a few cars arrive and then a mini-bus, loaded
with people. His nemesis, Sheriff Barrick Matthews, directed the men
and women where to march and handed each a sign. The men looked like
they&rsquo;d come from a labor pool, but the women appeared to be
from a club. And, of course, the media were right behind. Why would a
fellow correctional officer do this?<br>
&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; someone else shouted, &ldquo;This place
has a security wire around it. No wire, no prison. Rip it
out.&rdquo;<br>
Another voice shouted, &ldquo;Shovels in the trunk of my
car.&rdquo;<br>
A cable carrying 440 volts lay next to the wire that could sense the
transponder in an inmate&rsquo;s shoulder. The 440 volts wire
prohibited anyone from touching either wire. The voltage might not
bother a person who used a wooden-handled shovel, but let there be a
little water, or let the person grab the cable and &ndash; disaster.<br>
Delaney struggled to get up. &ldquo;The cable,&rdquo; he
yelled. The knee pushed him down harder.<br>
&ldquo;Let him up,&rdquo; a voice said. It was Sheriff
Matthews. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a prison official.&rdquo;<span
 class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br>
Surprise. Matthews helping him. Then he heard Matthews mutter,
&ldquo;What the hell. It don&rsquo;t matter.&rdquo;<br>
What was going to happen?<br>
The newswoman did a frantic voice-over. &ldquo;The protest against
this new prison has turned violent. Warden Tom Delaney&#61630;&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Stop,&rdquo; Delaney shouted at the men starting to dig
for the wire. A gravel path with a red florescent line sprayed on it
surrounded the prison, along with warning signs every hundred feet.<br>
Delaney hobbled over to the men, the pain where he&rsquo;d been
kicked shooting through his leg. The knee out of his new slacks.
&ldquo;You have to stop. You could be electrocuted.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re gonna shut you down,&rdquo; a man said.
&ldquo;This place is gonna wreck our town.&rdquo; He kept
digging.<br>
The camp was ten miles from Maria River. A small town in northern
Wisconsin, it had lost jobs, but Tom didn&rsquo;t see how his
experimental prison was going to wreck the town.<span
 class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br>
A vehicle approached on the rural Wisconsin highway. It was a
sheriff&rsquo;s van carrying his first prisoners. When it pulled up
to the protest line, Barrick Matthews strode over to it and talked to
the driver. Delaney limped over to the van as well, the newswoman right
behind him. This day couldn&rsquo;t be going worse, he thought.<br>
&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t enter,&rdquo; Sheriff Matthews said.<br>
The driver responded, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got five prisoners
here. Four men and one woman.&rdquo;<br>
Matthews spat on the ground. &ldquo;Men and women together. Holy
shit.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Let that van through,&rdquo; Delaney called out.
&ldquo;This is a court-ordered transfer.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m in charge,&rdquo; Matthews shouted.
&ldquo;Turn around. This camp don&rsquo;t meet State
standards.&rdquo;<br>
Delaney pushed himself forward to the van window. &ldquo;Go on in,
Driver. I&rsquo;ve had this camp inspected.&rdquo; He turned
eyeball to eyeball to the Sheriff. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re wrong,
Sheriff. Step away.&rdquo;<br>
Matthews pushed Delaney aside. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the Sheriff
here. My opinion counts. The place isn&rsquo;t fit. Turn
around.&rdquo;<br>
Delaney&rsquo;s heart sank as he watched the van turn around and
head back toward Maria River. The protestors cheered. The first day of
his new prison and &ndash; disaster. His dream &ndash; a prison
that really worked &ndash; defeated before it even opened. Never
mind digging up the cable. He was already shut down.<br>
He limped back down the entrance road to the warden&rsquo;s
cottage. He could still feel the imprint of the protestor&rsquo;s
knee in his back. But that wasn&rsquo;t the worst thing &ndash;
he had failed: failed to win Sheriff Matthews over, failed to build a
group of supporters in the town, and failed to win over the local
media. He was too impatient to get started, unwilling to slow the train
down so others could hop aboard. Crystal, his ex, used to say,
&ldquo;Tom, you see a problem and you jump. You don&rsquo;t
think it through.&rdquo;<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br>
His dream &ndash; gone. He wanted a prison that would melt the bars
surrounding an inmate&rsquo;s soul. For five years he&rsquo;d
planned this prison and done little else. He&rsquo;d visited
prisons with exciting programs in Europe, studied dense criminology
papers and talked to experts. He&rsquo;d written reports and
bounced them back to the experts for further comment. As well,
he&rsquo;d sent the plan to inmates he knew for their suggestions.
Redraft followed redraft and now the plan was ready and about to be
implemented, when &ndash; failure.<br>
He trudged forward. At least the protestors had stopped trying to dig
up the wire.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br>
But wait. He stopped walking. Maybe he could make it happen. One of his
key staff, Al Casey, was still in Maria River.<span
 class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br>
He punched a number on his cell phone.<span
 class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br>
        <br>
        <br>
Delaney retreated to the warden&rsquo;s cottage to recover. He was
a six-footer, still handsome in his early fifties, with a generous head
of black hair, gray scattered throughout. He sat at his small kitchen
table with a cup of coffee. The cottage was one level, small
everything, but adequate for his needs.<span
 class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br>
Tom picked up the Maria River Times. The paper quoted the county
commissioner, &ldquo;Maria River needs this federal experiment like
it needs a dozen tornadoes. Let Delaney coddle his criminals somewhere
else.&rdquo;<br>
Coddle criminals. That was the exact opposite of what he was doing. He
was sticking it to them for the first time in two hundred years of
American criminology. His plan was simple: No more do your time and get
out. Now it was you get out when you change.<span
 class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br>
Coddle criminals! His face reddened and he stood up to relieve the
anger.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br>
He took his coffee and walked to the window. Wisconsin spring air
rolled in from the glaciated hills, mixed with a hint of a
farmer&rsquo;s pungent fertilizer. Spring always brought him hope
and today his dream might still happen. He took a big breath to further
calm himself.<br>
A frown crossed his brow. Could he do it? He wasn&rsquo;t getting
any younger. Wheels were always coming off experiments and this one was
a revolution. The director of prisons in Washington, Mr. Kierney, had
made his position clear. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m against this project,
Mr. Delaney, but Congress wants experiments with new forms of prisons.
One year only.&rdquo;<br>
Delaney knew that Kierney wanted to give the contract to Sheriff
Matthews, who had submitted a proposal as he did. Matthews&rsquo;
proposal was for a maximum-security prison in Maria River, holding
thousands of prisoners and employing thousands of staff. But Congress
overruled Director Kierney.<br>
Looking up the road, Delaney saw that the media truck and the
protestors had left.<br>
He made another call on his cell phone and put on his jacket. It was a
chilly first of April in northern Wisconsin. Hell of a day for a new
prison to open, he thought. April Fool&rsquo;s Day. Certain
officials were, no doubt, enjoying a good joke on him. One of his
colleagues had said, &ldquo;Delaney wants to bring democracy to
Neanderthals. He&rsquo;ll learn.&rdquo;<span
 class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br>
His back hurt. As he reached for the doorknob, the house phone rang. He
answered it. &ldquo;Tom&hellip;I mean, Maria River Prison
Camp.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Hello, is this Mr. Delaney?&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;This is Anne-Marie Oakhurst. I&rsquo;m the mayor of
Maria River. I want to know if you&rsquo;re all right?&rdquo;<br>
The woman&rsquo;s voice surprised him. It flowed gently out of the
receiver like a stream, but there was firmness in the voice as well.<span
 class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br>
&ldquo;Ah, what do you mean, Mayor?&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;The demonstration this morning. I saw it on TV. I saw you
being shoved to the ground and kicked. I want you to know, Mr. Delaney,
that I oppose your prison experiment, but I don&rsquo;t approve of
those tactics. I hope you&rsquo;re all right.&rdquo;<br>
Words of calmness, rationality. That&rsquo;s how Crystal used to
talk in the early days, when he struggled to bring decent educational
programs to the men.<br>
&ldquo;Thank you, Mayor. I&rsquo;m fine.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Sheriff Matthews &ndash; his heart is in the right
place, but he gets carried away. I&rsquo;ve no idea where he got
those protestors.&rdquo;<br>
Delaney said nothing. Matthews&rsquo; heart was in big, cement and
steel prisons, men in cages, one staff for every inmate. Constant
lockdown and no rehabilitation.<br>
The mayor continued. &ldquo;Our area needs jobs, Mr. Delaney. We
lost a shoe factory to China and an auto parts factory to Mexico.
That&rsquo;s why Sheriff Matthews and I wanted a big prison
here.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;I understand&hellip;what do I call you? Madam Mayor?
Your Honor?&rdquo;<br>
She laughed. &ldquo;Anne-Marie&hellip;, just Anne-Marie. And
you?&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Tom. Tom Delaney.&rdquo;<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br>
&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m glad to hear you&rsquo;re all right,
Tom.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;You know, Mayor, &hellip; this camp will bring a lot of
good jobs to Maria River, counselors, psychologists, parole officers
and teachers. We just need time.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Yes, well we&rsquo;ll just have to see. Nice talking to
you, Tom.&rdquo;<br>
She hung up.<br>
Delaney put the phone down. The woman seemed confident in her own
authority. She didn&rsquo;t need people to bow and scrape and call
her &lsquo;Your Honor.&rsquo; She knew who she was &ndash;
Anne-Marie.<br>
As he walked out to the road, he realized that he should have sat down
with the mayor beforehand &ndash; the mayor and a lot of other
people. He kicked himself again for not preparing the community for an
innovative prison.<br>
A patch of crocuses had sprung up near the cottage. Sign of hope, he
thought. He placed another call on his cell phone and walked toward the
entrance, thoughts flooding his mind: the Department of Corrections
awarding him a plaque for his twenty years of educational leadership.
That was a joke, and the gold plaque on his kitchen wall reminded him
at every lonely meal what a phony he was. Except for his first two
years, he&rsquo;d just coasted, showed up for work and collected
his paycheck. EXCELLENCE the plaque said. His missionary brother
&ndash; that was a life of excellence. The picture came back to him
as it always did &ndash; his brother on a slab in a morgue in
Columbia, shot by the private troops of a rich landowner.<span
 class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br>
Yes, his brother on a slab. A martyr. That was the day he changed. No
more easy life, golfing, sailing, collecting the prison paycheck. Five
years of planning, now he had to succeed.<br>
The camp entrance was clear. He called again on his cell phone and a
few minutes later the same sheriff&rsquo;s van drove up and stopped
at the entrance. He walked over to the driver&rsquo;s side.
&ldquo;Good work, Al. They all here?&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Yep,&rdquo; Al said. &ldquo;Four men and one
woman.&rdquo;<br>
A policeman sat in the passenger seat. &ldquo;I appreciate you
coming along on this trip,&rdquo; Delaney said.<br>
The officer replied, &ldquo;&rsquo;Bout time someone tried
something new. Good luck to you, Sir.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Drive on, Al. I&rsquo;ll meet you in the big A-frame
building in half an hour. The woman will stay in the cottage with
Kali.&rdquo;<br>
Al laughed. &ldquo;Got to get all the chains off them
first.&rdquo;<br>
The van drove into the camp and Tom walked back down the road. He had
his experimental camp and his first five prisoners.<br>
Time to make it happen.</blockquote>
