      <p align="center"><b><font size="5">Internet in the Joint?</font></b></p>
      <p><font size="2">Published in the <i>Angolite</i>, an award
winning prison news magazine from the Louisiana State Penitentiary at
Angola. November/ December 2002, vol. 27, #6</font></p>
      <p>The man in 222 North has two daughters in elementary school.
Every night they send him an e-mail and he writes back to them.
Sometimes they ask him for help with their history homework. He checks
his facts on the web and then communicates with them by instant
messenger. Since his wife has to work longer now that he's doing time,
the kids depend on their father more for help with school. Because of
the Internet, he can help them.</p>
      <p>In 333 South the pictures on the wall show scenes from 3000
miles away. This man's parents worry about him and he worries about
them. Phone calls cost too much, so he keeps in touch with them by
e-mail which is free. Being connected to his family makes a big
difference in his life. His mother frequently scans in pictures of
friends and of their small farm. 333 South sees a picture of their rice
field ready for harvest. These scenes from home make him regret his
drug-running.</p>
      <p>After e-mailing his parents, 333 South logs on to Dave's ESL
cafe and takes an English grammar test on the web. After each test
question he can see the answer right away. He doesn't have to wait a
week until his teacher corrects him. He's doing a lot better with
English now.</p>
      <p>But evil lurks in 444 East. This man wants some hot Internet
sex. He types in an address a guy sold him for 3 smokes. A blue screen
comes up: BLOCKED. He goes to a good search engine and types in SEXY
SLUTS. Oh man, too good to be true, 133,000 sites. He clicks the first
one: BLOCKED. And the second and so on. All BLOCKED just as they are in
any secondary school.</p>
      <p>555 West works late into the night. He&rsquo;s getting out in
three months and he needs work. Even though the dot.com crisis has
eliminated a lot of computer jobs, he knows there's room for a system
administrator who knows UNIX and LINUX. He studies hard. No more prison
for him.</p>
      <p>He finishes at 1 AM. Used to be the last drink of the day at
that time. He misses it, so he signs on to AA ON-LINE.</p>
      <p>In the central guard room, On-Duty Joe sips his coffee and
smiles. Three months ago he got a lay-off notice. "Electronic security
has eliminated the need for&hellip;etc. etc. " But Joe is working
again. He monitors all Internet action. It's a beautiful job because he
knows who to watch. He sees 444 East go for the SEXY SLUTS. He chuckles
because he knows what's going to happen. But when 444 East gives up on
sex and sends an e-mail to someone demanding money, Joe goes into
action. He types a few numbers on his computer and 444 East is off the
web forever.</p>
      <p>Up in the front office during the day, the budget director is
happy. Internet access costs each guy $30 a month. 300 guys have signed
on, that's $9,000 a month. "After expenses," he tells the warden,
"we'll have a profit of at least $5,000 a month. Imagine that -- a
profit."</p>
      <p>This budget information fits neatly into the warden's report.
The local right wing politician screams about the prison predators
having access to the Internet. But the warden's report details the
safety measures and also notes a dramatic decrease in prison violence.</p>
      <p>The warden includes reports from his department heads: better
job preparation, more informed class room participation, closer family
ties, auto cad skills and so forth. There is a problem, however -- the
warden doesn't mention it in his report -- the men need more exercise
now.</p>
      <p>Out in the yard, the prison cynic flicks his smoke away.
"What's the big deal? Guys want to do crime, they don't need the
Internet to do it. A phone call and a coded message -- that's all it
takes.</p>
      <p>The chair of the lifers' group strikes a more positive note:
"The Internet is here to stay. It makes the world smaller and all of us
smarter. We need the Internet." </p>
