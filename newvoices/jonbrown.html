        John Brown</p>
        <p>grape jelly&nbsp;</p>
        <p>i'm through trying to emulate words<br>
        that have been coddled and sheltered from the world<br>
        by authors with silver egos and slicker tongues.</p>
        <p>i want to swallow my pens and<br>
        vomit images upon the page;</p>
        <p>to spank words<br>
        and send them red-bottomed from the room;</p>
        <p>to forget the dry syntax,<br>
        the politically correct anal froth<br>
        that sounds more nazi than reform.</p>
        <p>i want to abuse the english language<br>
        like finnigan's wake did the irish;<br>
        like gutter quebecois did the french</p>
        <p>i want words that smell sweet<br>
        as a half-naked thirty-something<br>
        in the back seat of a buick regal;</p>
        <p>words that are wet with fear<br>
        smuggled in sweat soaked blue-jeans<br>
        torn at the knees after a hard nights thieving&nbsp;</p>
        <p>words that suffocate in their cellophane wrappers<br>
        given away free in the candy stores of amerika,<br>
        breeding rebellion and</p>
        <p>inspiring the masses<br>
        of illiterate beggars who march through city streets<br>
        looking for scraps of food under padlocked dumpsters;</p>
        <p>i want seventy-five dollar pens that write seventeen cent poems,<br>
        to be thrown away when the ink has bled dry.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>i want words that offend;<br>
        words that rape priests<br>
        and send cheers through crowds of frightened children.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>i want words that question;<br>
        words that linger in the backs of throats<br>
        like half-dissolved aspirin.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>words that will duel anything ever written<br>
        at any time,<br>
        by anyone<br>
        and won’t even break a sweat.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>i want words that run salivating tongues along warm panty lines<br>
        in the bedrooms of lovers entangled in wet sheets<br>
        strangled in skin and salty sweat;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>that embrace lovers with indecision and guilt<br>
        as they make that horrifically long walk to the altar<br>
        or that longer stretch back home<br>
        to their waiting spouse's tapping foot<br>
        and wounded-dog cries&nbsp;</p>
        <p>words that sound like cherry bombs<br>
        exploding in a pranksters hand;<br>
        like gas shells over hamilton,<br>
        i want to be the fallout in my own city,<br>
        my country and preferably washington, dc.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>i want words that betray liars<br>
        while i lie paralysed on the beaches of france<br>
        or the deserts of morocco<br>
        crippled by scotch and heroin<br>
        cursing the sand<br>
        plagued by the piercing pitches of demons i've loosed<br>
        upon the eardrums of the world&nbsp;</p>
        <p>i want to be the laugh in the poetics of robbins,<br>
        the innocence of lerner's switchblade;<br>
        bathe the black indifference of vonnegut jr<br>
        with a voice and insolence all my own...&nbsp;</p>
        <p>i want my words to bleed grape jelly.<br>
        i want real emotion.</td>
