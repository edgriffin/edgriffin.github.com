        Mike Oulton</p>
        <p align="left">Bumper to bumper traffic. Insidious honking. Up one side
        of the street and down the other, past bumper to bumper pedestrians,
        around congested corners, disturbing the city pigeon’s afternoon snack
        of fallen crumbs from fast food sandwiches. 4:30 always seemed to come
        on like this. The noise. The impatience. God, the insignificance of it
        all. If you were ever in a rush at 4:30 p.m., during rush-hour, you had
        better be prepared to be let down, or late.</p>
        <p align="left">I couldn’t help but check my watch. Ten minutes in
        this mess seemed like hours. I had plenty of time. <i>At least 40
        minutes.</i> The rush of the rush-hour never trapped me. I always
        calculated the time I’d probably spend wasting away in traffic into
        every appointment. Crush hour – in this mess, you had to have at least
        an hour to crush.</p>
        <p align="left">I checked my hair in the rearview mirror for the third
        time out of sheer boredom. Everything was still in place. I felt secure
        in the brown turtleneck pullover and black corduroy jeans. Not too
        flashy, but stylish. The first impression was everything. Everything.
        Those people who didn’t believe that either lacked a sense of style or
        lacked self-respect. Of all the things that I’d learned about dating
        was that women needed a good first impression. They need that wave of
        comfort from a man when they first meet. The comfort always helps them
        to relax, and a relaxed woman equals a good date.</p>
        <p align="left">All I know is that firsts are a big deal with women.
        First kiss. First love. First time. Whenever a first occurs, a woman
        will never forget it so long as they still have the ability to think.
        They remember every smell, every sound associated with the historical
        event. They keep journals, diaries, files, documents containing every
        shred of information associated with the first. They keep the joyous
        event sheltered in a lock box in the depths of their mind, under lock
        and key, and when it’s opened, it’s only opened for a good friend or
        someone they really trust. When the box is opened, adrenaline is shot
        down a pipeline that protrudes out the back. The line travels down to
        the eyes, which creates a sparkle, cascades down to the heart, creating
        a quicker tempo and then rockets back up to the mouth where it explodes
        out into the air as accelerated bursts of words formulated so that only
        other equally excited women can understand. And when the words come,
        they come with great detail. Feelings, sensations, thoughts. They tell
        about words spoken, smells and how they changed, feelings that
        manipulated her mind throughout the duration of the first. Her story
        explodes into the day like the first warm sunrise of spring that catches
        you unexpectedly in the morning. The birds announce it’s return to the
        cold bitten world, the trees rejoice, the flowers thank God for the
        electricity to open their arms for the sweet gift of life. the women of
        the world get up, put away their winter jackets and greet the pleasant
        sunshine.</p>
        <p align="left">Men? We roll over and go back to sleep.</p>
        <p align="left">I checked my watch again.</p>
        <p align="left"><i>Only 30minutes to spare.</i> <i>The hands on my watch
        must have moved more than my car.</i></p>
        <p align="left">This was the first time that I’d dared the 4:30
        traffic in my car, but there was always a first time for everything.
        First kiss. First love. First time. All I know was that firsts were just
        that – firsts. First of a long line of manys. To most men, firsts were
        like chicken wings before the meal came. A warm-up. A way to experiment
        before the actual time came when they needed to look like a pro. The
        only special thing about firsts in men’s eyes, was the &quot;first
        time exemption&quot;. All men used it. In fact, it’s an unwritten law
        in the circle of the male species. It was created for a one time use,
        but men fully abuse the &quot;first time amendment&quot; every time they
        screw up. It’s who we are. It’s what we do. To us, first times
        aren’t even that special, but we pretend that they are. If you ever
        ask a man if it’s his first time, most will probably say no. That’s
        because the word FIRST is actually an acronym for &quot;For It’s
        Really the Sixth Time&quot;. You’d be hard fought to find a group of
        men sitting around describing smells and sounds associated with their
        firsts. We don’t even mention anything we do until we’ve got it down
        perfect. Until we’re pros. I could never tell my best friend what
        sounds were around me during my first kiss. It was hard enough trying to
        prevent from drooling down my chin and banging my head against hers –
        and all this with my eyes closed. And where women giggled and admired
        our quirkiness, our awkwardness – we would never admit to that. Men
        lie. We don’t admit to mistakes. We meant to do it. It was our move.</p>
        <p align="left">To men, firsts are like the first day at school. You go
        in, you get into a fight and beat up some poor kid, and after that, kids
        either want to be your friend or they keep away from you. We just jump
        into it and hope for the best.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;Come on!&quot; I screamed out the window.</p>
        <p align="left"><i>20 minutes to spare. A blind date, what was I
        thinking?</i></p>
        <p align="left">The Mustard tree restaurant at 5:00. I knew what I was
        getting into and still I breached one of the fundamentals of blind
        dating – no daylight. Strangers love the night. It hides
        imperfections. That’s why the strangers met in the night in the old
        song. Actually, the idea was hers. She felt that we should start the
        date earlier so that we wouldn’t be rushed. Confident. She was
        probably a looker. I had never been one for an intelligent, methodical
        woman who preplanned her life. That was probably due to my own
        insecurities. Really, I don’t know a guy that wants a woman more
        organized than himself. With organization comes power. With power comes
        abusing power. It’s an evil chain reaction that, in a relationship,
        only leads to and argument or a nasty breakup.</p>
        <p align="left">Like those first arguments in a new relationship.
        They’re no one’s fault. They just happen. One person dares to take
        the first step at testing the other’s patience. It’s a natural
        occurrence. After experiencing all the other firsts, they become curious
        to see what would happen if they did… this! It really comes down to
        getting all the firsts out of the way, good and bad. Once they’ve been
        dealt with, life can resume as normal.</p>
        <p align="left">The cars in front of me moved. I exhaled and put the
        transmission in drive. My car hit a record high of 6 mph as I managed to
        get past the lights and around the corner towards the city center.
        Twenty-five minutes to get around a corner. Unbelievable. Within minutes
        I had my car parked in the Mustard Tree’s parking lot, and with one
        last hair inspection, I left my ego in the passenger seat and entered
        the restaurant.</p>
        <p align="left">This was my first time at the ‘Tree’ – as so many
        of my friends had called it. Everyone I knew had been here. I’d driven
        by so many times on my way to the gym or work thinking about how I’d
        like to eat here one day. I’d always thought that it looked like a
        nice place to bring a date – a first date? It just so happened that
        when I was introduced by phone to …Samantha that she’d recommended
        that we meet at the ‘Tree’.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;Samantha, Samantha,&quot; I repeated over and over
        out loud as I waited to be seated.</p>
        <p align="left">I had to remember her name. I was really bad at first
        names. I could never remember, even a minute after hearing it. I glanced
        up at the ceiling of the ‘Tree’. I’d read somewhere about name
        association. Something about rhyming, or numbers. The entire restaurant
        was painted a pale yellow from top to bottom. The ceiling had to be 25
        feet high cluttered with bamboo ceiling fans. The entire restaurant was
        defiled with strange exotic plants. Not a mustard tree in sight.
        Clematis vines stretched up the sides of the walls, wrapping around
        framed pictures and following the square pattern of every door in the
        place. Soft rock played in the backdrop. The smell of garlic and mango
        chutney spiced up the somber atmosphere.</p>
        <i>
        <p align="left">Sam – fan.</p>
        </i>
        <p align="left">A set of perfectly set white teeth wrapped in crimson
        red packaging surrounded by a shiny nest of brunette hair approached me
        in the entranceway of the restaurant. A warm sensation expanded from the
        center of my body, across my chest, down the length of my appendages.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;Table for one?&quot;</p>
        <p align="left">Her voice traveled euphoniously into my head, disturbing
        thoughts as to why I was there in the first place. The rhythmic tempo of
        her words was as pure as silence on a deserted stretch of beach.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
        <p align="left">It was all I could say. Galaxy blue eyes, generous
        curves. Her hair, soft to my unfulfilled touch. I wanted to run my
        fingers down the length of her head. What was going on? Why was I here?
        I remembered that I needed an extra chair.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;All right.&quot;</p>
        <p align="left">She turned away and led me to a small square table with
        a single menu in her hand. I followed her with a hunger so savage,
        though not for the mango chutney, but for just a whisper of her name.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;Here we are,&quot; she said, and placed the menu
        on the tabletop. I could hear the sounds of the kitchen behind me.</p>
        <p align="left">My eyes focussed on her hips as I sat down in the chair.
        They seemed to sway even as she stood. Maybe it was me. The subtle back
        and forth motion hypnotized me to the point that my eyes became two
        round saucers, my pupils, like a birds eye view of a cup of coffee.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;We have mango chicken as our special
        tonight.&quot;</p>
        <p align="left">I blinked out of my trance. A lavacious eyebrow
        accentuated the blue pools beneath. I smiled and nodded that I
        understood.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;Oh,&quot; I said before she left. &quot;I forgot,
        I’m meeting someone here.&quot;</p>
        <p align="left">She stood up straight.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;A blind date actually.&quot;</p>
        <p align="left">Why had I said that? She half turned around and scanned
        the restaurant. The smile disappeared replaced only by a condescending
        frown which pleaded to know how I could have forgotten about such an
        important occasion. I felt like a loser. What an impression. The worst
        kind too – typical. The last thing any man wanted was to be thought of
        as &quot;typical&quot;.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;Okay,&quot; she said. It sounded like a question.
        &quot;I’ll move a chair over.&quot;</p>
        <p align="left">I abruptly stood, knocking the table with my knee.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;No. I’ll get one.&quot;</p>
        <p align="left">Her face stiffened. The warm sensation became a hot
        flash that surged up my body into my face. Two crucial first impression
        mistakes – absent-mindedness and chauvinistic. She was an obviously
        capable woman. Independent. Beautiful. Her job was to move chairs. Sit
        people down in them. She was empowered. The last thing she wanted was a
        typical forgetful man dressed in a forty-dollar turtleneck, unable to
        grasp the concept of equality doing her job. I would not stand out in a
        crowd of men. Not in this woman’s eyes. What did she think about the
        whole blind date thing? &quot;What a loser. The guy can't even get a
        date himself. He’s probably too busy trying to figure out new ways to
        control women rather than attempting to get to know one. Didn’t even
        remember why he was here. Typical.&quot;</p>
        <p align="left">I backed away from the extra chair at the next table and
        let her slide it over.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;Thanks,&quot; I said.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;No problem.&quot;</p>
        <p align="left">She smiled and left me to wallow in self-pity. My stare
        remained focussed on her rhythmic sway until she disappeared around a
        corner of the room. What a woman. Even though I’d made myself out to
        be a stereotypical man, I think she liked me. I thought I saw a little
        extra &quot;a&quot; in her sway as she walked away.</p>
        <p align="left">I sat back in my chair and exhaled a sigh of relief. I
        still had the opportunity to play my &quot;first time exemption&quot;
        card. It was all I needed. I could say that the first time I laid eyes
        on her, I did things and said things that were beyond my own power. I
        could say that she made me feel giddy, like a schoolboy confronted in a
        playground romance. Even if she psychoanalyzed our first meeting, my
        first impression, she could take my excuse and work with it, apply it to
        all areas of our brief, yet inspirational, conversation. She would have
        to; if I even stood a chance with her. I knew that a when a woman sees
        absentmindedness, the only things that enters her head are all the
        birthdays, anniversaries and words spoken at tender moments that I’m
        potentially bound to forget. She imagines all the times that I might be
        late. Late for dinner. Late for the wedding. Late for the birth of our
        first child. If I had interrupted her from getting the extra chair, I
        would have made one of the worst statements that I could have made.
        First it’s the chair, then I won’t let her drive, or carry the heavy
        boxes, or pay for dinner.</p>
        <p align="left">That’s why the exemption is so important. The mere
        mention that she had me spellbound and that her aura was making me say
        and do stupid things, allows me a return. A new start. A second first
        impression.</p>
        <p align="left"><i>Ah, the beauty of being a man</i>.</p>
        <p align="left">Another sharp breeze of mango chutney wafted by my face.
        A sense of nostalgia came over me as I inhaled the sweet aroma in
        through my nose. The memory of this moment took the long walk towards
        the back of my mind and into the storage area. Amidst the useless sports
        information and pictures of women long past, the mango, the soft rock
        mixed with the clattering of glasses and dull laughter found its place
        locked away available for reminiscence at any time. A new feeling of
        importance swept over me. A surge of adrenaline raced through my body. I
        knew what I had to do. If this woman was going to be mine, I had to let
        her know. I had to take the time and tell her about myself, use the
        exemption, and tell her how I feel. If she were ever going to be happy,
        she had to take a moment to listen to what I had to say.</p>
        <p align="left">Silently she returned to my table. She poured a glass of
        water and placed it in front of me. My eyes traced the outline of her
        arm up to her eyes.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;Is everything all right?&quot;</p>
        <p align="left">Her delicate tone reassured my confidence.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;Yes, yes – fine.&quot;</p>
        <p align="left">I licked my lips and reached for the glass of water.
        What could I say? How do I begin? My heart bounced inside my chest. I
        wiped my palms on my lap. I could feel the damp spot through the thick
        layer of corduroy. Then, without any sort of control, I blurted the
        first thing that came to my head.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;So, what’s your name?&quot;</p>
        <p align="left">She smiled and stood up straight. A look danced across
        her eyes. One that comes around while admiring the curiosity of a young
        child.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;Marney,&quot; she said. &quot;I’ll get your
        server.&quot;</p>
        <p align="left">And she left.</p>
        <p align="left">I cringed. What was I thinking? Here I was, awaiting the
        arrival of my blind date… I glanced up at the ceiling…Samantha, and
        I was trying to hit on another woman. Hitting on a hostess of all
        people.</p>
        <p align="left">Typical. Now she definitely thinks that I’m typical.
        Nothing outside the norm.</p>
        <p align="left">I know now what my plan is. I have to ditch the blind
        date, use the exemption on Mary…Margaret – whatever her name is,
        tell her how I feel then somehow convince her that she should go on a
        date with me and lay on the charm.</p>
        <p align="left">Sounds from the street pierced the soft rock silence. I
        turned to see a blonde hair woman with very athletic legs standing alone
        at the entrance. She glanced nervously around the restaurant before
        settling her eyes on me, alone in the corner… extra chair… forty
        dollar turtleneck. She smiled at me. I waved a hand at her. Her walk
        seemed slow and deliberate. I watched her as she checked the hem of her
        dress and removed the light jacket she had draped across her shoulders.</p>
        <p align="left">Her look was very casual, like my own. A short peach
        skirt with a matching top twisted snugly around her voluptuous body. Her
        Swiss alp type features were sharp enough to attract any man, by my mind
        was elsewhere. Nothing that this blonde bombshell had compared to my
        Margy…Mable…</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;Hi…Mike?&quot;</p>
        <p align="left">I sat silent. Up close, she was even more beautiful.
        Clean in every sense of the word. Her hair, her face. Her smile was as
        clear as her skin – beautiful. But my thoughts remained on… the
        other girl.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;Yes, hi…&quot; I glanced up at the ceiling.
        &quot;…Samantha, please.&quot;</p>
        <p align="left">I gestured to the seat across from me. I began to stand,
        but then I remembered my important mission. I let the gesture ride and
        rested back down. I pushed the chair out with my foot. It stumbled out
        from under the table, almost hitting her in the leg.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;Argh,&quot; she sighed and draped her jacket on
        the back of the chair. &quot;The traffic is crazy. I can't believe all
        the rush - and everyone at the same time. You’d think that…&quot;</p>
        <p align="left">She stopped. It may have been because I had my head
        buried in the menu and was paying her no attention.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;…Ah….&quot; she was speechless, absolutely
        speechless.</p>
        <p align="left">I giggled to myself behind the oversized menu. The first
        impression from hell, no – deeper. I heard her clear her throat.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;Oh,&quot; I shook my head. &quot;Where’s my
        manners?&quot;</p>
        <p align="left">I took a sip of the water in front of me, fishing a
        couple of ice shards out with my tongue. When my mouth was full, I
        poured half the glass into an empty one in front of her. She watched me
        with rounded eyes of disbelief. I swallowed the water in my mouth.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;Oh, sorry,&quot; I said, and poked a couple ice
        shards into her glass with my finger all the while crunching the ones in
        my mouth. I watched her perfect neck ripple as she swallowed a mouthful
        of shock.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;Ah, thanks,&quot; she replied and raised the glass
        to her lips, then put it back down on the table.</p>
        <p align="left">In my head I laughed. I howled like a demented scientist
        about to unleash his monster on the world. Insensitive, ignorant, crude
        – words I long to hear before the end of the evening.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;So, Mike,&quot; she leaned on the table with both
        elbows. A smile on her face hid her obvious resentment of my abusive
        manner. The ole ‘job’ question. Very important on the first date,
        and very important in the demise of the blind date. Whatever I told her
        would determine if she came back for another try. Gynecologist – no,
        too rich. Stripper agent – no, too alluring. Ah, male gigolo – no,
        too intriguing.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;I’m a writer,&quot; I said, leaning back in my
        chair. Broke and living in an imaginary world, perfect. I suddenly
        wished that I had worn a dirty white T-shirt.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;Really,&quot; she said. A twinkle appeared in her
        eyes. &quot;What do you write?&quot;</p>
        <p align="left">I shrugged and dipped my finger into my glass of water,
        stirring the ice around.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;Good stuff. Penthouse forum. Porno’s. You know,
        the &quot;I can't believe it would ever happen to me&quot; type
        stories.&quot;</p>
        <p align="left">She nodded her head and leaned back in her chair. I
        watched one of her perfectly manicured eyebrows raise. Her eyes
        narrowed, vexing me silently.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;Yeah, it’s okay.&quot; I was on a roll, I could
        feel it. &quot;Pays about $200 a week. Sometimes more. Depends how
        frisky I’m feeling – know what I mean?&quot;</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;Sure,&quot; she said. &quot;Whatever does it for
        you.&quot;</p>
        <p align="left">An awkward pause ensued. Naturally, the next proper
        thing to do would be to ask her about her own profession, but not today.
        Today, I didn’t care. I glanced at my watch then searched the
        restaurant for my little hostess.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;I’m a teacher,&quot; she threw at me. &quot;I
        teach 5<sup>th</sup> grade.&quot;</p>
        <p align="left">I kept my eyes away from hers. A simple nod and my
        attention was quickly diverted to a particle of fluff that had found its
        way onto my $40 turtleneck. I swiped it off with the gracefulness of an
        eagle flapping its wings on a calm day.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;I like kids,&quot; she continued on in a passive
        tone. &quot;They’re so… natural. They have a sense of innocence
        that’s so … captivating.&quot;</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;Yeah,&quot; I said, picking up my menu again.
        &quot;I want to have lots of kids-.&quot; My eyes widened.
        &quot;Actually, I just want to go through the motions. The kid part –
        whatever. If they come, they come.&quot;</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;Hmm,&quot; she stated.</p>
        <i>
        <p align="left">That one had to hurt.</p>
        </i>
        <p align="left">I knew I had her on the ropes. I could feel that she was
        about to storm out of the restaurant at any moment. I could feel her
        loath for me – hot and malicious – from across the table. She had to
        hate me by now. I’d done nothing even close to gentlemanly. Bad
        manners, worse comments – terrible first impression. Soon she would
        get up and storm out the door. I’d then use my exemption on
        &quot;what’s her name?&quot;, we would sit down on her break, have a
        little mango chicken and we’d live happily ever after.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;You know something Mike-,&quot;</p>
        <p align="left">Here it came. I folded my menu on the tabletop and let
        my most charming smile fly.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;-I don’t meet many guys like you.&quot;</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;Really,&quot; I said with a warm touch of
        mock-sincerity. A cocky right eyebrow egged her on.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;Yeah,&quot; she swiped a lock of golden hair out
        of her face. &quot;I mean, most guys usually shower me with compliments.
        It’s so tiring fighting off all those smooth talkers. But you…&quot;</p>
        <p align="left">Not me baby. I don’t need you. You’re a necessary
        casualty; a stepping stone to real heaven. Like a human purgatory.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;…You. You haven’t tried to placate me at all.
        It’s almost as if you’re not interested. Am I right? Do you even
        want to be here with me Mike?&quot;</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;Does that bother you?&quot; I asked, leaning
        forward, closer to her, anticipating an open palm across my face.</p>
        <p align="left">Her face remained passive. She put both elbows on the
        table and rested her head in her hands.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;Actually -,&quot;</p>
        <p align="left">Her voice lowered to a near whisper. A scent of roses
        emanated from somewhere deep within her bosom. I inhaled the fragrance,
        savoring its potency, unconvinced by its seductive power.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot; – It really turns me on.&quot;</p>
        <p align="left">Her top lip curled upwards and she released a low growl.
        One of her French tip hands reached out and touched mine. I tried to say
        something, but instead broke out into a violent coughing spasm. Suddenly
        all the floral air I’d been holding in my lungs, anticipating her act
        of violence, burst out in a loud barfing gasp, echoing throughout the
        entire restaurant and circling back hitting me like…like… a slap in
        the face.</p>
        <p align="left">The barfing noise must have thrown her off. My
        discomfort must have been apparent to everyone in the restaurant, not
        just her. she leaned back in her chair. A confused grimace crossed her
        face. I took a sip of my water. It was luke warm.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;You mean it turns you off,&quot; I said when I
        finally stopped choking.</p>
        <p align="left">She smiled and licked her lips. Her eyes narrowed almost
        completely shut concealing the sparkle trapped within the icy blue
        pools.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;No, not at all. I actually respect men more when
        they tell the truth. Honesty is a hard thing to find – especially now
        a days.&quot;</p>
        <p align="left">Where was she headed with all this talk? who did she
        think she was? I wasn’t going to fall in to that trap – that… good
        girl, bad boy…. A flash sensation of urgency shot up from my feet.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;I lied,&quot; I yelled and stood up. my chair slid
        out from under me and toppled to the floor.</p>
        <p align="left">The entire restaurant ceased eating and turned their
        attention towards me. I saw her blush and peer around at all the
        complete strangers gawking our direction.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;I’m not a writer.&quot; My throat felt dry. I
        swallowed hard and thought even harder. &quot;I’m actually just a
        street sweeper – actually, I don’t even sweep… I ride around in a
        street cleaner at five in the morning.&quot;</p>
        <p align="left">What could I say? I sat back down and picked the menu
        back up, but when it fell to the floor, I ignored it and swallowed the
        last of my warm water. When I looked at … her, I noticed that her face
        had a look of utter confusion.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;So… you lied.&quot;</p>
        <p align="left">Finally, she was on the right track.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;Yes,&quot; I nearly screamed. &quot;I’m actually
        not a nice guy at all. I’m a complete asshole. I’ve even been to
        jail, and I’ve hit a woman once, not hard, but she was asking for
        it.&quot;</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;Really?&quot;</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;Yes damn it. Don’t you understand. I’m not the
        kind of guy that you need. I’ll only break your heart. Waiting for me
        to come home at all hours of the night, catching me with other women,
        hanging out with thugs, drinking, breaking things…ah, I can feel your
        pain already.&quot;</p>
        <p align="left">She was very attentive during my entire spiel – along
        with an old couple at the adjoining table. Her eyes and ears absorbing
        every second of sight and sound. This had to be it. No matter how
        desperate this chick was, she would hate me with an acrimonious passion
        by the end of all this. and if she didn’t, why would I want someone
        that dysfunctional anyway.</p>
        <p align="left">She sat up straight in her chair and began reorganizing
        the cutlery in front of her.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;Well,&quot; she said. The word was stiff.</p>
        <p align="left">She tucked a strand of her honey suckle hair behind her
        ear. Her lips pressed together hard, causing them to turn white, then,
        slid a tongue out across them, lapping seriously at the cherry colored
        hue. She had to want to go. Leave. Leave me with my self-righteous
        shallowness. Leave me in shame to question why the hell I would throw
        away an opportunity to have a perfectly normal relationship with a sexy
        woman to pursue another that I hadn’t even met or said a single
        intelligent word to. Leave me to settle my nerves, order two mango
        chickens with extra mango chutney, use the exemption over a bottle of
        Robert Mondavi, get ‘what’s her names’ phone number and still make
        it home in time to catch the second quarter of the game. god, typical
        sure is great sometimes.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;If that’s all – I don’t mind.&quot;</p>
        <p align="left">She stretched her manicured palm across the table and
        gave my hand a squeeze. I was frozen to the surface of the table. All I
        could do was stare straight ahead. What was this woman made of.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;No,&quot; I said and pulled my hand away.
        &quot;you do mind. Damn it, you do mind. You’re a good girl. A nice
        girl. You need a man that can make you happy.&quot;</p>
        <p align="left">She pulled my hand back towards her. &quot;Oh, I know
        what will make me happy.&quot;</p>
        <p align="left">A large swallow of guilt rippled my throat. Something in
        this woman’s eyes told me that I’d just unleashed a beast more
        powerful than a mohel at a bar mitzvah.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;Listen, ah…&quot;</p>
        <p align="left">I looked up at the ceiling fan. My head was spinning. I
        had to get her away. Out of the corner of my eye I saw my princess. She
        danced across the restaurant floor towards a couple sitting at a corner
        table by the front window. She had in her dainty hand a tray topped with
        yellow and red fifi drinks with yellow paper umbrellas. Her balance was
        immaculate. Her body remained straight and poised even as she bent over
        to place the drinks in front of the patrons. I felt a tremor in my
        pants. My legs were shaking uncontrollably. And then she did it. I heard
        myself gasp for breath as she made a half turn in my direction, took a
        look at…ah… the woman beside me, and winked one of her blueberry
        cotton eyes.</p>
        <p align="left">I couldn’t back down now. I had the woman of my dreams
        just where I wanted her. we were in pre-flirt mode – and in front of
        my date. Everything that I wanted in a sophisticated brunette –
        sassiness, confidence, aggression – I had to have her. I had to eat
        mango chutney off of her stomach.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;How bout it sexy, do you want to go back to my
        place? Maybe a little probing for your … stories.&quot;</p>
        <p align="left">I turned back to my blind date. Blind, yes. Blind to the
        emotional ass kicking I was about to lay on her. She had no idea what I
        could do if I thought about it. Nothing.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;Listen, I really like you, but…&quot; I
        swallowed hard. This was outside the rules of blind dating. The wild
        card so to speak. If the date ever got to a point where you needed to
        go, and I mean go, the wild card was the one ticket out the door.
        Guaranteed. &quot;I can't go with you… I’m … gay.&quot;</p>
        <p align="left">Her head snapped back and the dove white palm lined with
        pink tips retracted.</p>
        <p align="left">Ah, success. Sweet, sweet, success.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;What?&quot; her voice crackled.</p>
        <p align="left">I knew that tone. The crackle was just the beginning of
        the breakdown. It hurt to actually have to use the wild card, but it was
        due. Hard nosed women were the worst to get rid of. Some women really
        need a man and they’ll go through anything just to get one.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;You’re gay?&quot;</p>
        <p align="left">A few heads turned our direction. Screw it – play it
        out.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;Yeah. Gay. Actually, this blind date was sort of
        an experiment for me. I wanted to see if I was one hundred
        percent.&quot;</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;And?&quot; she said.</p>
        <p align="left">I held my hands up and shrugged my shoulders.
        &quot;Sorry.&quot;</p>
        <p align="left">We sat in silence for a minute while I left her to bask
        in the powerful ambiance of my revelation. The only bad part about
        playing the wild card was that she would tell her friends and I would
        forever be the gay guy whenever we met on the street. It basically took
        me out of the running with any of her friends, but that was not
        important. All I needed was my little mango chutney chicken girl to make
        me straight.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;Totally gay?&quot;</p>
        <p align="left">The final reach. I knew it all too well. if she was
        truly interested in me, she would make that last minute attempt at
        conversion. But I would have to stand strong and soon I would be free.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;Yeah, I’m actually a single gay man. I’m
        looking as well. spread the news.&quot;</p>
        <p align="left">I laughed and flicked my wrist at her. she watched my
        hand snap in mid air with a look of horror on her face. She leaned back
        in her chair, spent. I could see it in her face. The champ had been
        defeated. Down comes the wall, the show is over.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;Well, this is a first.&quot;</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;Yeah,&quot; I reached for her hand. &quot;I’m
        sorry that I didn’t tell you before.&quot;</p>
        <i>
        <p align="left">Play it to the bone.</p>
        </i>
        <p align="left">&quot;Yeah me too,&quot; she sighed. &quot;You mean you
        don’t like women at all. Not even a little?&quot;</p>
        <p align="left">I shook my head. &quot;Do brown shoes go with a green
        purse?&quot;</p>
        <p align="left">I had no idea what the hell that meant, but it sounded
        gay. <i>Right to the end old boy. Follow the trail until you see the
        sun.</i></p>
        <p align="left">&quot;Actually, I’ve never been interested in women at
        all. Even in school. I remember watching boys in the change rooms and in
        the showers after soccer practice.&quot;</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;Really?&quot; she leaned forward, intrigued –
        but uninterested.</p>
        <p align="left">I winked at her. <i>And the award goes to…</i></p>
        <p align="left">&quot;Sure girl! I knew I was gay the moment I saw my
        first… wienie. I remember that day as if it were yesterday.&quot;</p>
        <p align="left">I giggled a little fluttery than usual. That seals this
        one – bring on the main course.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;Gee…well.&quot;</p>
        <p align="left">She folded her arms across her chest and took a glance
        around the restaurant, searching for a way out. For a moment I felt a
        tinge of pain in my heart for her. The wild card was never easy. I
        don’t know how I would feel if a woman told me that she was gay.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;Listen, Sam. You can go if you like. I don’t
        blame you. I’m sorry for getting your hopes up and all. I really do
        like you. You’re a sweet girl. Maybe one day we could go shopping…
        or something.&quot;</p>
        <p align="left">She smiled. What great teeth.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;Yeah. Okay. That would be great.&quot; She scanned
        the room again. &quot;I’m going to go and use the phone.&quot; She
        stood up. &quot;I’ll be right back.&quot;</p>
        <p align="left">I waved her off with a dainty fingertip slap to the side
        of her leg. The corner of her mouth quirked downward and she left me
        alone. I inhaled ferociously. Ah, the invigorating feeling of freedom.
        How long has it been? Poor Samantha, I hate to see you go, but I love to
        watch you walk away. It breaks my heart to have to be this way, but I
        have needs and desires – like all men. I knew, in the back of my head,
        that my chances with her weren’t totally blown. There was always the
        ‘I’m not gay anymore’ exemption, used mainly in times of
        desperation and drastic forlornness. To women, a gay man was like a
        twenty-something year old virgin who already knows all the moves. It’s
        like having a VCR that sets its own time. For women, having sex with a
        gay man was like being his first.</p>
        <p align="left">And I know how much women love their firsts.</p>
        <p align="left">When she returned to the table, she didn’t sit down. I
        stood to usher her back to her chair, but she held up a hand.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;Actually Mike, I’m gonna go.&quot;</p>
        <p align="left">I bowed my head and pursed my lips. &quot;It’s okay.
        I… understand. I just hope you’re …okay.&quot;</p>
        <p align="left">She removed her jacket from the back of the chair and
        draped it across her forearm. I watched with hidden exuberance as the
        once beautiful smile began to take an awful new shape. The sparkle in
        her eyes disappeared. The cleanliness had turned to dirty shame. She had
        a look of shame, probably because of what I’d done. I tried hard not
        to laugh. Whatever got her out the door. Suddenly I saw her shake and
        she broke into tears.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;Samantha, what’s wrong? Why are you
        crying?&quot;</p>
        <p align="left">I was more amazed at the fact that I’d remembered her
        name than the sensitivity I potrayed.</p>
        <i>
        <p align="left">Damn am I good.</p>
        </i>
        <p align="left">&quot;Oh,&quot; she said and reached for the cloth
        napkin on the table. &quot;I think that I’m destined to be alone
        forever.&quot;</p>
        <p align="left">I thought carefully about my next bit of words. Not too
        sensitive. I didn’t want her to have the urge to stay. I knew how
        women liked to unload on gay men.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;No you won’t.&quot; I moved over to her side of
        the table. &quot;You’ll find someone.&quot;</p>
        <p align="left">She sniffled and patted her eyes. &quot;Do you think
        so?&quot;</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;Sure.&quot; I put my arm around her shoulders.
        &quot;You’re gorgeous. You’d make any guy happy.&quot;</p>
        <p align="left">I removed my arm. She adjusted the collar of her jacket
        and sniffled again.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;What you need to do is go home and call up a
        friend and talk about how you feel. That always helps me when I feel
        down.&quot;</p>
        <p align="left">Good touch. Good gay touch. I almost had myself
        convinced.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;Actually,&quot; she sniffled. &quot;I’m giving
        my friend a ride home. Maybe her and I can go out tonight. She’s
        single too.&quot;</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;There you go,&quot; I said with a smile.
        &quot;Right back in the saddle.&quot;</p>
        <p align="left">She bit her bottom lip, then offered me a final goodbye
        grin.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;You’re a sweet guy Mike. It was nice meeting
        you.&quot;</p>
        <p align="left">She offered her hand. I shook it without squeezing it at
        all. Mere seconds away from freedom, solitude – myself. My real self.
        Masculinity here I come. Moments until the woman of my dreams walks into
        my life and away with my heart. I could taste the mango from inside her
        belly button hole. I could imagine the wooziness of our heads from the
        Mondavi, our hearts full of wild, unbridled, unadulterated passion.
        Mango passion. Chicken mango induced passion.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;Okay Sam, I’m ready.&quot;</p>
        <p align="left">I blinked my eyes twice. My imagination was running
        wild. I thought I saw my mango lover standing in front of me. She smiled
        at me and then turned her face away. Then, with the gracefulness of
        yellow tuna, she put her arm around Samantha’s shoulder and turned her
        around towards the door. Her back looked just as beautiful as her
        front…</p>
        <p align="left">Her back?</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;Bye Mike,&quot; said Samantha. She turned and
        waved at me with just her fingers.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;Wait!&quot; I yelled across the room.</p>
        <p align="left">A fork slammed down onto a plate across the room.
        &quot;Damn it, I’ve had enough!&quot;</p>
        <p align="left">I turned to the direction where the noise had come from.
        An angry older man in a tan T-shirt wiped his mouth and pointed a finger
        at me.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;Would you sit your gay ass down and shut up.
        You’ve ruined everybody’s dinner all night.&quot;</p>
        <p align="left">I swallowed hard. Even the girls had stopped walking
        away to take in the scene erupting in the restaurant.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;I’m sorry,&quot; I said to the man.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;Damn it!&quot; His wife pulled him back down into
        his seat.</p>
        <p align="left">I shook my head. What was happening? Did he say gay ass?
        The girls turned around and headed back out the door. This wasn’t
        supposed to happen like this. I was supposed to be leaving with what’s
        her name, not what’s her name.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;Wait,&quot; I called out to them again.</p>
        <p align="left">A fork crashed down onto a plate.</p>
        <p align="left">Both women turned around, looks of scorn adorned their
        faces. Adorned their faces, no, more like corrupted. I had corrupted
        their beauty with my lies. My gay lies. Little white gay lies. No, they
        were more like big black gay lies. The thought made me shudder.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;If you don’t shut up, I’m gonna shut you
        up!&quot;</p>
        <p align="left">The older man was on his feet again. He had his wife at
        his side, pulling on his arm to sit back down. A young waiter came out
        from the back room to assist in the commotion. Every eye in the
        restaurant was on me.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;But, I…&quot;</p>
        <p align="left">I was tongue-tied. I tried to speak, but all that came
        out was a gurgle and a gasp.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;That’s it!&quot; screamed the older man.
        &quot;I’m gonna kick your gay ass.&quot;</p>
        <p align="left">What was my next move? My feet felt hammered to the
        floor. I glanced over at the older man in the tight tan shirt stomping
        my way. I looked over at the girls who were huddled together, looks of
        concern now challenged their faces. There was no exemption for a moment
        like this. I know, I had written the book on exemptions. My only choice
        left was the most drastic move of all. There was only one thing that
        could ease me out of a situation as bad as this. I had to play the trump
        card.</p>
        <p align="left">I fainted.</p>
        <p align="left">I felt the hard floor below me and heard the gasps of
        the restaurant patrons. Footsteps rushed to my side. My eyes were
        closed. I felt a pair of hands lift my head off the ground.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;Mike, Mike, are you okay? Can you hear me?&quot;</p>
        <p align="left">It was Samantha. She sounded worried. Don’t open your
        eyes just yet. I had to hear her voice.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;Is he okay?&quot;</p>
        <p align="left">There she was. I could feel her right above me. The
        scent of mango chutney wafted into my nostrils. My heart sped up. I
        needed a grand awakening. Was it her that was holding my head? Her voice
        sounded so close, like I could reached upwards with my lips and touch
        her own. The hands under my head were smooth. They caressed the back of
        my skull as I lied there contemplating my return to the conscious world.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;He’s going to be okay. Everybody get back.&quot;
        It was a man’s voice. &quot;I know first aid.&quot;</p>
        <p align="left">Ah, first aid won’t help me. The only thing I needed
        was the soft, supple lips of… what’s her name, on mine. Should I
        fake a seizure? No, too late. Maybe amnesia. Maybe I could awake and not
        realize that I’m gay. How perfect. I could wake up and be a straight
        guy, totally oblivious to my sexual orientation. The good old amnesia
        exemption. It might just work.</p>
        <p align="left">Slowly I opened my eyes to the protruded face of a black
        man about an inch away from mine.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;He’s awake!&quot;</p>
        <p align="left">I looked frantically from left to right. People were
        crowded all around me, looking down and whispering to one another. The
        man in the tan T-shirt stood to the right of the black man. Hie fist
        pounding into his open palm.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;Good, get him up,&quot; said the tan shirt man.
        &quot;So I can knock him back down.&quot;</p>
        <p align="left">I sat up gingerly to get a look at the rest of the room.
        Where were they?</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;Are you okay?&quot; asked the black man.</p>
        <p align="left">I nodded. Where were they? I touched my hand to my
        forehead.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;You took quite the fall.&quot;</p>
        <p align="left">I felt his hand rub my bare shoulders, under my
        forty-dollar turtleneck, then move down my back. Where were the girls?
        Where had they gone…</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;Get him up!&quot; yelled the tan shirt man.</p>
        <p align="left">…how could the girls just get up and leave me on the
        floor like that? How callous could a person be?</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;It’s okay cutie pie, you’re in good hands.
        You’re in Romeo’s hands now.&quot;</p>
        <p align="left">…what about my exemption? What about the mango and the
        Mondavi?</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;Get him up and his feet god-dammit!&quot;</p>
        <p align="left">…this wasn’t supposed to happen. I was in the
        driver’s seat. I was supposed to be the one walking out the door with
        what’s her name, not the other what’s her name.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;Settle down tiger. Let Romeo rub your lower
        back.&quot;</p>
        <p align="left">…I used the trump card and I was about to use the
        ‘I’ve got amnesia take me to your house because I don’t remember
        where I live and I’m not gay’ exemption. Where was my reward for all
        my hard work and consideration? Where was my retribution for my
        suffering?</p>
        <p align="left">Wait a minute… who the hell is cutie pie?</td>
