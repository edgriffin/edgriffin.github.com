Griffin marches from Selma to
Montgomery with Dr. Martin Luther&nbsp;King. He feels alive,
living his religion. When he returns to his all-white parish in a
suburb of Cleveland, Ohio, he discovers that some parishioners have
threatened the pastor of the parish, his superior. &ldquo;Get that
nigger-lover out of here or we&rsquo;ll never contribute another
dime.&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Griffin is moved to a church in
Cleveland&rsquo;s slums. He&rsquo;s hurt. His church has not
stood behind him. His disillusionment grows as he sees the
church&rsquo;s indifference to the problems of the poor. He leaves
the priesthood in 1968.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Does he abandon his priesthood? Forget about
helping people? No, but he eliminates the vocabulary of religion and
searches for what ennobles and empowers people. He helps young people
sort through life&rsquo;s problems. He serves a term as a city
councilman in Milwaukee, builds a successful business and teaches in
prison. Everywhere he tries to lead people to a higher level. In
marriage, he finally discovers the love he preached about as a priest.
He learns what it means to be a &lsquo;father&rsquo; by really
being one.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Griffin lives the spirit of ministry, stripped of
religion and exercised in the world. Others who love the work, but
suffer under institutional rules, will see hope in his life. Any reader
who has wrestled with helping others will enjoy Griffin&rsquo;s
spiritual journey.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">The book includes:</span><br>
      <ul>
        <li>In the seminary Griffin is conservative, a favorite of the
faculty. His
best friend is his opposite, a freethinking seminarian, Charlie.</li>
        <li>Griffin is ordained, but doesn&rsquo;t really become a
Christian
until the civil rights movement forces him to.</li>
        <li>He meets and marches with Dr. Martin Luther King in Selma.</li>
        <li>Some people in his suburban parish put pressure on the
bishop to get
rid of Griffin. The bishop moves him to Cleveland&rsquo;s poorest
area, where he learns how little the church actually cares about racism
and poverty. He leaves the priesthood in 1968.</li>
        <li>A thirty-two virgin starts to date. He knows nothing about
dating and
very little about women. </li>
        <li>Griffin meets his future wife and they get to know each
other as they
knock on 11,000 doors in his political campaign.</li>
        <li>As the election draws closer, Griffin needs to get one more
brochure
out, but he doesn&rsquo;t have the money. A reputed Mafia bar owner
meets with him and hands him $900 under the table. Griffin accepts it
without a qualm, until&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</li>
        <li>Griffin is elected and hopes to help people</li>
        <li>After four years he and his wife and now -- two small
children -- throw
caution to the wind and buy a commercial greenhouse, a business they
know nothing about.</li>
        <li>Thirteen years later they do it again, something wild, that
is. Griffin
is 52 then. They leave their native land and a profitable business and
move across North America to British Columbia, Canada. </li>
        <li>In BC he starts to teach writing, first one class, then
another and
another. Writing groups form. People get together and they establish
the Surrey International Writers' Conference. Griffin also starts
teaching writing in prison in 1993.</li>
        <li>The doctor says he has cancer in 1996. His world is
shattered. The
doctor operates and then tells Griffin. "Sorry, Ed, we didn't get it
all." Griffin learns to live with cancer</li>
        <li>He experiences a second spring, a spiritual renewal. </li>
      </ul>
